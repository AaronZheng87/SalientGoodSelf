\hypertarget{participants.}{%
\subsection{Participants.}\label{participants.}}

The experiments (except experiment 3b) reported in the current study were first conducted between 2014 to 2016 in Tsinghua University, Beijing, participants of these experiments were recruited in Tsinghua University community. To increase the power by adding collecting more data so that each experiment has 50 or more valid data (Simmons, Nelson, \& Simonsohn, 2013) , we recruited additional participants in Wenzhou University, Wenzhou, China in 2017. However, duo to the limited time and resources, additional data were not collected for experiment 2, 3, and 4b.

\hypertarget{material-and-procedure}{%
\subsection{Material and Procedure}\label{material-and-procedure}}

In the current study, we used the social associative learning paradigm (Sui, He, \& Humphreys, 2012), in which participants first learn the associations between geometric shapes and labels of person with different moral valence (e.g., in first three studies, the triangle, square, and circle and good person, neutral person, and bad person, respectively). The associations of the shapes and label were counterbalanced across participants. After learning phase, participants finish a practice phase to familiar with the task, in which they viewed one of the shapes upon the fixation while one of the labels below the fixation and judged whether the shape and the label were matched. When participants can get 60\% or higher accuracy at the end of the practicing session, they can start the experimental task which is the same as in the practice phase.

If not noted, E-prime 2.0 was used in all experiments. For participants recruited in Tsinghua University, they finished the experiment individually in a dim-lighted chamber, stimuli were presented on 22-inch CRT monitors, with a chin-rest brace. The visual angle of geometric shapes was about 3.7º × 3.7º, the finxation cross is of (0.8º × 0.8º of visual angle) at the center of the screen. The words were of 3.6º × 1.6º visual angle. The distance between the center of the shape or the word and the fixation cross was 3.5º of visual angle. Participant fixed their head on a chin-fixation, about 60 cm from the screen.

For participants recruited in Wenzhou University, they finished the experiment in a group consist of 3 \textasciitilde{} 12 participants in a dim-lighted testing room. Participants were required to finished the whole experiment independently. Also, they were instructed to start the experiment at the same time, so that the distraction between participants were minimized. The stimuli were presented on 19-inch CRT monitor. The visual angles are could not be exactly controlled because participants's chin were not fixed.

\hypertarget{data-analysis}{%
\subsection{Data analysis}\label{data-analysis}}

We reported all the measurements, analysis and results in all the experiments in the current study. All data were first pre-processed using R R (Version 3.6.0; R Core Team, 2018) and the R-packages \emph{afex} (Version 0.23.0; Singmann, Bolker, Westfall, \& Aust, 2019), \emph{BayesFactor} (Version 0.9.12.4.2; Morey \& Rouder, 2018), \emph{boot} (Version 1.3.22; Davison \& Hinkley, 1997; Gerlanc \& Kirby, 2015), \emph{bootES} (Version 1.2; Gerlanc \& Kirby, 2015), \emph{coda} (Version 0.19.2; Plummer, Best, Cowles, \& Vines, 2006), \emph{corrplot2017} (Wei \& Simko, 2017), \emph{dplyr} (Version 0.8.0.1; Wickham et al., 2019), \emph{emmeans} (Version 1.3.4; Lenth, 2019), \emph{forcats} (Version 0.4.0; Wickham, 2019a), \emph{Formula} (Version 1.2.3; Zeileis \& Croissant, 2010), \emph{ggformula} (Version 0.9.1; Kaplan \& Pruim, 2019), \emph{ggplot2} (Version 3.1.1; Wickham, 2016), \emph{ggstance} (Version 0.3.1; Henry, Wickham, \& Chang, 2018), \emph{ggstatsplot} (Version 0.0.10; Patil \& Powell, 2018), \emph{here} (Version 0.1; Müller, 2017), \emph{Hmisc} (Version 4.2.0; Harrell Jr, Charles Dupont, \& others., 2019), \emph{lattice} (Version 0.20.38; Sarkar, 2008), \emph{lme4} (Version 1.1.21; Bates, Mächler, Bolker, \& Walker, 2015), \emph{MASS} (Version 7.3.51.4; Venables \& Ripley, 2002), \emph{Matrix} (Version 1.2.17; Bates \& Maechler, 2019), \emph{MBESS} (Version 4.4.3; Kelley, 2018), \emph{mosaic} (Version 1.5.0; Pruim, Kaplan, \& Horton, 2017, 2018), \emph{mosaicData} (Version 0.17.0; Pruim et al., 2018), \emph{multcomp} (Version 1.4.10; Hothorn, Bretz, \& Westfall, 2008), \emph{mvtnorm} (Version 1.0.10; Genz \& Bretz, 2009), \emph{papaja} (Version 0.1.0.9842; Aust \& Barth, 2018), \emph{plyr} (Version 1.8.4; Wickham et al., 2019; Wickham, 2011), \emph{psych} (Version 1.8.12; Revelle, 2018), \emph{purrr} (Version 0.3.2; Henry \& Wickham, 2019), \emph{RColorBrewer} (Version 1.1.2; Neuwirth, 2014), \emph{readr} (Version 1.3.1; Wickham, Hester, \& Francois, 2018), \emph{reshape2} (Version 1.4.3; Wickham, 2007), \emph{stringr} (Version 1.4.0; Wickham, 2019b), \emph{survival} (Version 2.44.1.1; Terry M. Therneau \& Patricia M. Grambsch, 2000), \emph{TH.data} (Version 1.0.10; Hothorn, 2019), \emph{tibble} (Version 2.1.1; Müller \& Wickham, 2019), \emph{tidyr} (Version 0.8.3; Wickham \& Henry, 2019), and \emph{tidyverse} (Version 1.2.1; Wickham, 2017). The clean data were analyzed using JASP (0.8.6.0, www.jasp-stats.org, (Love et al., 2019)). Participants whose overall accuracy lower than 60\% were excluded from analysis. Also, the accurate responses with less than 200ms reaction times were excluded from the analysis.

We analyzed accuracy performance using a signal detection approach, as in Sui et al.~(2012). The performance in each match condition was combined with that in the nonmatching condition with the same shape to form a measure of d'. Trials without response were coded either as \enquote{miss} (matched trials) or \enquote{false alarm} (mismatched trials). The d' were then analyzed using repeated measures analyses of variance (repeated measures ANOVA).

The reaction times of accurate trials were also analyzed using repeated measures ANOVA. To control the false positive when conducting the post-hoc comparisons, we used Bonferroni correction. Please note that in the first two experiment (experiment 1a and 1b), we included the variable matchness (matched vs.~mismatched) in our ANOVA of reaction times and then examine matched trials and mismatched trials separately when the interaction between matchness and other variables are significant. In both experiments, we found significant interaction between matchness and valence. Then, as previous study, we focused on the matched trial for the rest of the experiment (Sui et al., 2012).

We reported the effect size of repeated measures ANOVA (omega squared) (Bakeman, 2005; Lakens, 2013). Also, we reported Cohen's d and its 95\% confidence intervals for the post-hoc comparisons. To provide more information about the results, we also reported the Bayes Factor using JASP (Hu, Kong, Wagenmakers, Ly, \& Peng, 2018; Wagenmakers et al., 2018). The Bayes factor is the ratio of the probability of the current data pattern under alternative hypothesis (H1) and the probability of the current data pattern under null hypothesis (H0), which index the relative evidence for these two hypotheses from the current data. The BF10 represents the evidence for alternative hypothesis (H1) vs.~evidence for null hypothesis (H0); in contrast, BF01 represents that evidence for null hypothesis over the evidence for althernative hypothesis. We used the default prior in JASP for all the Bayes Factor analyses, and used Jeffreys (1961)'s convention for the strength of evidence: the BF10 \textgreater{} 3 means there are some evidence for H1 as compared with H0, BF10 great or equal to 10 means strong evidence for H1.

To assess the individual difference, we explored correlation between self-reported psychological distance and more objective responses bias (i.e., reaction times and d prime). To do this, we first normalized the personal distance by taking the percentage of the mean distance between each two persons in the sum of all 6 distances (self-good, self-normal, self-bad, good-normal, good-bad, normal-bad), and then calculated the bias score (indexed by the differences between good-normal, good-bad). Also, as exploratory analysis, we analyzed the correlation between behavioral response and moral identity, self-esteem, if data are available. As recent study showed that small size leads to unstable correlation estimates (Schönbrodt \& Perugini, 2013), we only reported the correlation based on data pooled from all experiments, while the results of each experiment were reported in supplementary results.

\subsection{Methods}\label{methods}}

\hypertarget{participants}{%
\subsubsection{Participants}\label{participants}}

57 college students (38 female, age = 20.75 \(\pm\) 2.54 years) participated. 39 of them were recruited from Tsinghua University community in 2014; 18 were recruited from Wenzhou University in 2017. All participants were right-handed except one, and all had normal or corrected-to-normal vision. Informed consent was obtained from all participants prior to the experiment according to procedures approved by the local ethics committees. 6 participant's data were excluded from analysis because nearly random level of accuracy, leaving 51 participants (34 female, age = 20.72 \(\pm\) 2.44 years).

\hypertarget{stimuli-and-tasks}{%
\subsubsection{Stimuli and Tasks}\label{stimuli-and-tasks}}

Three geometric shapes were used in this experiment: triangle, square, and circle. These shapes were paired with three labels (bad person, good person or neutral person). The pairs were counterbalanced across participants.

\hypertarget{procedure}{%
\subsubsection{Procedure}\label{procedure}}

As we describe in general method part, this experiment had two phases. First, there was a learning stage. Participants were asked to learn the relationship between geometric shapes (triangle, square, and circle) and different person (bad person, a good person, or a neutral person). For example, a participant was told, \enquote{bad person is a circle; good person is a triangle; and a neutral person is represented by a square.} After participant remember the associations (usually in a few minutes), participants started a practicing phase of matching task which has the exact task as in the experimental task.
In the experimental task, participants judged whether shape--label pairs, which were subsequently presented, were correct. Each trial started with the presentation of a central fixation cross for 500 ms. Subsequently, a pairing of a shape and label (good person, bad person, and neutral person) was presented for 100 ms. The pair presented could confirm to the verbal instruction for each pairing given in the training stage, or it could be a recombination of a shape with a different label, with the shape--label pairings being generated at random. The next frame showed a blank for 1100ms. Participants were expected to judge whether the shape was correctly assigned to the person by pressing one of the two response buttons as quickly and accurately as possible within this timeframe (to encourage immediate responding). Feedback (correct or incorrect) was given on the screen for 500 ms at the end of each trial, if no response detected, \enquote{too slow} was presented to remind participants to accelerate. Participants were informed of their overall accuracy at the end of each block. The practice phase finished and the experimental task began after the overall performance of accuracy during practice phase achieved 60\%.
For pariticpants from the Tsinghua community, they completed 6 experimental blocks of 60 trials. Thus, there were 60 trials in each condition (bad-person matched, bad-person nonmatching, good-person matched, good-person nonmatching, neutral-person matched, and neutral-person nonmatching). For the participants from Wenzhou Univeristy, they finished 6 blocks of 120 trials, therefore, 120 trials for each condition.

\hypertarget{questionnaires}{%
\subsubsection{Questionnaires}\label{questionnaires}}

After the experiment, part of the participants in Tsinghua University also finished psychological distance, trait social justice (Bai, 2013), cognitive reflection test (Frederick, 2005), and disgust senstivity (Tan, Cong, \& Lu, 2007). The psychological distance measurement finished by indicating the the psychological distance between self, good person, bad person and neutral person, through two points on a horizontal line. This procedure is presented by Matlab. This method had been proven been an effective way to measure the psychological distance (Enock, Sui, Hewstone, \& Humphreys, 2018).
For all participants from Wenzhou University, they finished following questionnaires online immediately after the experiment: objective and subjective socioeconomic status (the objective SES measured by parents' education and occupation (Shi \& Shen, 2007), the subjective SES measured by ladder task (Ostrove, Adler, Kuppermann, \& Washington, 2000)), psychological distance (Enock et al., 2018), sensitivity to justice (Wu et al., 2014), cognitive reflection test (Frederick, 2005), disgust senstivity scale (Tan et al., 2007), belief in just world (short) (Wu et al., 2011), a short version of big five personality (John \& Srivastava, 1999), trait self-esteem (Rosenberg, 1965), locus of control (Levenson，1981), Free will and determinism plus (FAD+) (translated version) (Liu, Jian, Hu, \& Peng, 2015; Paulhus \& Carey, 2010), moral identity (Aquino \& Reed II, 2002), and moral self image (translated version) (Jordan, Leliveld, \& Tenbrunsel, 2015). Only the psychological distance data were analyized in the current study.

We conducted a single factor (morlaity: good, neutral, bad) repeated measure ANOVA:

We found the effect of Valence (\(F(2, 100) = 6.19\), \(\mathit{MSE} = 0.26\), \(p = .003\), \(\hat{\eta}^2_G = .020\)).

\end{table}

We further examined the effect of valence.

The Good condition (2.23 \(\pm\) 0.14) is great than Netural condition (2.05 \(\pm\) 0.16, t(45) = 1.67, p = 0.226) and bad condition (1.87 \(\pm\) 1.4, \emph{t}(45) = 3.07, \emph{p} = 0.01, Cohen'd = 0.36). This is no-significant difference between neutral and bad conidition, \emph{t}(45) = 1.81, p = 1.77.

\hypertarget{analaysis-of-reaction-time.}{%
\subsubsection{Analaysis of reaction time.}\label{analaysis-of-reaction-time.}}

We conducted 2 (Matchness: Match v. Mismatch) by 3 (Valence: good, neutral, bad) repeated measure ANOVA:

We found the main effect of Matchness (\(F(1, 50) = 232.39\), \(\mathit{MSE} = 948.92\), \(p < .001\), \(\hat{\eta}^2_G = .104\)), main effect of valence (\(F(1.87, 93.31) = 9.62\), \(\mathit{MSE} = 1,673.86\), \(p < .001\), \(\hat{\eta}^2_G = .016\)), and intercation between Matchness and Valence (\(F(1.73, 86.65) = 8.52\), \(\mathit{MSE} = 1,441.75\), \(p = .001\), \(\hat{\eta}^2_G = .011\))

We carried out two separate ANOVA for both Match and mismatched trials. For matched trials, we found the effect of valence . For non-matched trials, there was no significant effect of Valence ().

We further examined the effect of valence for both self and other for mached trials. We found that shapes associated with Good Person responded faster than Neutral (t(45) = -2.662, p = 0.0284) and Bad Person (\emph{t}(45) = -4.793, \emph{p} = 0.0001). Neutral condition is slightly faster than bad condition (t(45) = -2.33, p = 0.0618)

72 college students (49 female, age = 20.17 \(\pm\) 2.08 years) participated. 39 of them were recruited from Tsinghua University community in 2014; 33 were recruited from Wenzhou University in 2017. All participants were right-handed except one, and all had normal or corrected-to-normal vision. Informed consent was obtained from all participants prior to the experiment according to procedures approved by the local ethics committees. 20 participant's data were excluded from analysis because nearly random level of accuracy, leaving 52 participants (36 female, age = 20.25 \(\pm\) 2.31 years).

\hypertarget{stimuli-and-tasks-1}{%
\subsubsection{Stimuli and Tasks}\label{stimuli-and-tasks-1}}

Three geometric shapes (triangle, square, and circle, with 3.7º × 3.7º of visual angle) were presented above a white fixation cross subtending 0.8º × 0.8º of visual angle at the center of the screen. The three shapes were randomly assigned to three labels with different moral valence: a morally bad person (\enquote{恶人}, ERen), a morally good person (\enquote{善人}, ShanRen) or a morally neutral person (\enquote{常人}, ChangRen). The order of the associations between shapes and labels was counterbalanced across participants.
Three labels used in this experiment is selected based on the rating results from an independent survey, in which participants rated the familiarity, frequency, and concreteness of eight different words online. Of the eight words, three of them are morally positive (HaoRen, ShanRen, Junzi), two of them are morally neutral (ChangRen, FanRen), and three of them are morally negative (HuaiRen, ERen, LiuMang). An independent sample consist of 35 participants (22 females, age 20.6 ± 3.11) were recruited to rate these words. Based on the ratings (see supplementary materials Figure S1), we selected ShanRen, ChangRen, and ERen to represent morally positve, neutral, and negative person.

\hypertarget{procedure-1}{%
\subsubsection{Procedure}\label{procedure-1}}

For participants from both Tsinghua community and Wenzhou community, the procedure in the current study was exactly same as in experiment 1a. For participants in Tsinghua community, they finished a survey suite include personal distance, objective and subjective SES, belief in just world (Wu et al., 2011), disgust senstivity scale (谭永红 et al., 2007), trait justice (Wu et al., 2014), and cognitive reflection test (Frederick, 2005). For participants from Wenzhou community, they finished exactly the same questionnaires as the participants from Wenzhou University in experiment 1a.

There was evidence for the main effect of valence, \(F(2, 102) = 14.98\), \(\mathit{MSE} = 0.16\), \(p < .001\), \(\hat{\eta}^2_G = .053\). Paired t test showed that the Good-Person condition (1.9 \(\pm\) 0.104) was with greater \emph{d} prime than Netural condition (1.49 \(\pm\) 0.1, \emph{t}(49) = 5.583, \emph{p} \textless{} 0.001, Cohen's \emph{d} = 0.415). We also found that the Bad-Person condition (1.71 \(\pm\) 0.11) has also greater \emph{d} prime than neutral condition , \emph{t}(49) = -3.106, \emph{p} = 0.008, Cohen's \emph{d} = -0.229). There was no-significant difference between Good and bad conidition, \emph{t}(49) = 2.05, \emph{p} = 0.11.

These results confirmed the facilitation effect of positive moral valence on the perceptual matching task. This pattern of results mimic prior results demonstrating self-bias effect on perceptual matching (Sui et al., 2012) and in line with previous studies that indirect learning of other's moral reputation do have influence on our subsequence behavior (Fouragnan et al., 2013).

In this study, we further control the valence of words using in our experiment. Instead of using label with moral valence, we used valence-neutral names in China. Participant first learn behaviors of the different person, then, they associate the names and shapes. And then they perform a name-shape matching task.

23 college students (15 female, age = 22.61 \(\pm\) 2.62 years) participated. All of them were recruited from Tsinghua University community in 2014. Informed consent was obtained from all participants prior to the experiment according to procedures approved by the local ethics committees. No participant was excluded because they overall accuracy were above 0.6.

\subsubsection{Stimuli and Tasks}\label{stimuli-and-tasks-2}}

Three geometric shapes (triangle, square, and circle, with 3.7º × 3.7º of visual angle) were presented above a white fixation cross subtending 0.8º × 0.8º of visual angle at the center of the screen. The three most common names were chosen, which are neutral in moral valence before the manipulation.
Three names (Zhang, Wang, Li) were first paired with three paragraphs of behavioral description. Each description includes one sentence of biographic infomration and four sentences that describing the moral behavioral under that name. To assess the that these three descriptions represented good, neutral, and bad valence, we collected the ratings of three person on six dimensions: morality, likability, trustworthiness, dominance, competence, and aggressiviess, from an independent sample (n = 34, 18 female, age = 19.6 ± 2.05). The rating results showed that the person with morally good behavioral description has higher score on morality (M = 3.59, SD = 0.66) than neutral (M = 0.88, SD = 1.1), \emph{t}(33) = 12.94, \emph{p} \textless{} .001, and bad conditions (M = -3.4, SD = 1.1), \emph{t}(33) = 30.78, \emph{p} \textless{} .001. Neutral condition was also significant higher than bad conditions \emph{t}(33) = 13.9, \emph{p} \textless{} .001 (See supplementary materials).

After arriving the lab, participants were informed to complete two experimental tasks, first a social memory task to remember three person and their behaviors, after tested for their memory, they will finish a perceptual matching task.
In the social memory task, the descriptions of three person were presented without time limitation. Participant self-paced to memorized the behaviors of each person. After they memorizing, a recognition task was used to test their memory effect. Each participant was required to have over 95\% accuracy before preceding to matching task.
The perceptual learning task was followed, three names were randomly paired with geometric shapes. Participants were required to learn the association and perform a practicing task before they start the formal experimental blocks. They kept practicing util they reached 70\% accuracy. Then, they would start the perceptual matching task as in experiment 1a. They finished 6 blocks of perceptual matching trials, each have 120 trials.

\hypertarget{experiment-2-sequential-presenting}{%
\section{Experiment 2: Sequential presenting}\label{experiment-2-sequential-presenting}}

Experiment 2 was conducted for two purpose: (1) to further confirm the facilitation effect of positive moral associations; (2) to test the effect of expectation of occurrence of each pair. In this experiment, after participant learned the assocation between labels and shapes, they were presented a label first and then a shape, they then asked to judge whether the shape matched the label or not (see (Sui, Sun, Peng, \& Humphreys, 2014). Previous studies showed that when the labels presented before the shapes, participants formed expectations about the shape, and therefore a top-down process were introduced into the perceptual matching processing. If the facilitation effect of postive moral valence we found in experiment 1 was mainly drive by top-down processes, this sequential presenting paradigm may eliminate or attenuate this effect; if, however, the facilitation effect ocured because of button-up processes, then, similar facilitation effect will appear even with sequential presenting paradigm.

The results of 1 participants were excluded from analysis because of less than 60\% overall accuracy, remains 34 participants (17 female, age = 21.74 \(\pm\) 3.04).

\hypertarget{procedure-3}{%
\subsubsection{Procedure}\label{procedure-3}}

In Experiment 2, the sequential presenting makes the matching task much easier than experiment 1. To avoid ceiling effect on behavioral data, we did a few pilot experiments to get optimal parameters, i.e., the conditions under which participant have similar accuracy as in Experiment 1 (around 70 \textasciitilde{} 80\% accuracy).
In the final procedure, the label (good person, bad person, or neutral person) was presented for 50 ms and then masked by a scrambled image for 200 ms. A geometric shape followed the scrambled mask for 50 ms in a noisy background (which was produced by first decomposing a square with ¾ gray area and ¼ white area to small squares with a size of 2 × 2 pixels and then re-combine these small pieces randomly), instead of pure gray background in Experiment 1. After that, a blank screen was presented 1100 ms, during which participants should press a button to indicate the label and the shape match the original association or not. Feedback was given, as in study 1. The next trial then started after 700 \textasciitilde{} 1100 ms blank. Other aspects of study 2 were identical to study 1.

\hypertarget{discussion-2}{%
\subsection{Discussion}\label{discussion-2}}

In this experiment, we repeated the results pattern that the positive moral valenced stimuli has an advantage over the neutral or the negative valenced association. Moreover, with a croass task analysis, we didn't found evidence that the experiment task interacted with moral valence, suggesting that the effect might not be effect by experiment task.
These findings suggested that the facilitation effect of positive moral valence is robust and not affected by task. This robust effect detected by the associative learning is unexpected.

38 college students (15 female, age = 21.92 \(\pm\) 2.16) participated in experiment 3a. All of them were right-handed, and all had normal or correted-to-normal vision. Informed consent was obtained from all participants prior to the experiment according to procedures approved by a local ethics committee. One female and one male student did not finish the experiment, and 1 participants' data were excluded from analysis because less than 60\% overall accuracy, remains 35 participants (13 female, age = 22.11 \(\pm\) 2.13).

\hypertarget{design}{%
\subsubsection{Design}\label{design}}

Study 3a combined moral valence with self-relevance, hence the experiment has a 2 × 3 × 2 within-subject design. The first variable was self-relevance, include two levels: self-relevance vs.~stranger-relevance; the second variable was moral valence, include good, neutral and bad; the third variable was the matching between shape and label: match vs.~mismatch.

\hypertarget{stimuli}{%
\subsubsection{Stimuli}\label{stimuli}}

The stimuli used in study 3a share the same parameters with experiment 1 \& 2. 6 shapes were included (triangle, square, circle, trapezoid, diamond, regular pentagon), as well as 6 labels (good self, neutral self, bad self, good person, bad person, neutral person). To match the concreteness of the label, we asked participant to chosen an unfamiliar name of their own gender to be the stranger.

\hypertarget{procedure-4}{%
\subsubsection{Procedure}\label{procedure-4}}

After being fully explained and signed the informed consent, participants were instructed to chose a name that can represent a stranger with same gender as the participant themselves, from a common Chinese name pool. Before experiment, the experimenter explained the meaning of each label to participants. For example, the \enquote{good self} mean the morally good side of themselves, them could imagine the moment when they do something's morally applauded, \enquote{bad self} means the morally bad side of themselves, they could also imagine the moment when they doing something morally wrong, and \enquote{neutral self} means the aspect of self that doesn't related to morality, they could imagine the moment when they doing something irrelevant to morality. In the same sense, the \enquote{good other}, \enquote{bad other}, and \enquote{neutral other} means the three different aspects of the stranger, whose name was chosen before the experiment. Then, the experiment proceeded as study 1a. Each participant finished 6 blocks, each have 120 trials. The sequence of trials was pseudo-randomized so that there are 10 matched trials for each condition and 10 non-matched trials for each condition (good self, neutral sef, bad self, good other, neutral other, bad other) for each block.

In study 3a, participants had to remember 6 pairs of association, which cause high cogitive load during the whole exepriment.

Study 3b were finished in 2017, at that time we have calculated that the effect size (Cohen's d) of good-person (or good-self) vs.~bad-person (or bad-other) was between 0.47 \textasciitilde{} 0.53, based on study 1a, 1b, 2, 3a, 4a, and 4b. Based on this effect size, we estimated that 54 participants would allow we to detect the effec size of Cohen's = 0.5 with 95\% power and alpha = 0.05, using G*power 3.192 (Faul, Erdfelder, Buchner, \& Lang, 2009; Faul, Erdfelder, Lang, \& Buchner, 2007). Therefore, we planned to stop after we arrived this number. During the data collected at Wenzhou University, 61 participants (45 females; 19 to 25 years of age, age = 20.42 \(\pm\) 1.77) came to the testing room and we tested all of them during a single day. All participants were right-handed, and all had normalneutral or corrected-to-normal vision. Informed consent was obtained from all participants prior to the experiment according to procedures approved by a local ethics committee. 4 participants' data were excluded from analysis because their over all accuracy was lower than 60\%, 1 more participant waw excluded because of zero hit rate for one condition, leaving 56 participants (43 females; 19 to 25 years old, age = 20.27 \(\pm\) 1.60).

Study 3b has the same experimental design as 3a, with a 2× 3× 2 within-subject design. The first variable was self-relevance, include two levels: self-relevant vs.~stranger-relevant; the second variable was moral valence, include good, neutral and bad; the third variable was the matching between shape and label: match vs.~mismatch.
Stimuli. The stimuli used in study 3b share the same parameters with experiment 3a. 6 shapes were included (triangle, square, circle, trapezoid, diamond, regular pentagon), as well as 6 labels, but the labels changed to \enquote{good self}, \enquote{neutral self}, \enquote{bad self}, \enquote{good him/her}, bad him/her'', \enquote{neutral him/her}, the stranger's label is consistent with participants' gender. Same as study 3a, we asked participant to chosen an unfamiliar name of their own gender to be the stranger before showing them the relationship. Note, because of implementing error, the personal distance data didn't collect for this experiment.

In this experiment, participants finished two matching tasks, i.e., self-matching task, and other-matching task.

In the other-matching task, participants first associate the three aspects of the stranger to three different shapes, and then perform the matching task. The order of self-task and other-task are counter-balanced among participants.
Different from experiment 3a, after presenting the stimuli pair for 100ms, participant has 1900 ms to response, and they were feedbacked with both accuracy and reaction time.
As in study 3a, before each task, the intruction showed the meaning of each label to participants. The self-matching task and other-matching task were randomized between participants. Each participant finished 6 blocks, each have 120 trials.

Paired \emph{t}-tests showed that responses to the good-self association (817 ± 119) were faster than to bad-self associations (915 ± 132), \emph{t}(55) = -8.78, \emph{p} \textless{} 0.001, Cohen's \emph{d} = -1.173, 95\% CI {[}-1.511 -0.828{]}, BF10 = 1.84e+9, and to neutral-self association (880 ± 116), \emph{t}(55) = 3.748, \emph{p} \textless{} 0.0001, Cohen's \emph{d} = -0.501, 95\% CI {[}-0.777 -0.221{]}, BF10 = 58.7. The neutral-self was faster than the bad-self associations, \emph{t}(55) = -2.41, \emph{p} = 0.019 , Cohen's \emph{d} = -0.321, 95\% CI {[}-0.589 -0.051{]}, BF10 = 2.03.
The effect of moral valence was also significant for the stranger-relevance conditions, \(F(1.89, 103.94) = 5.96\), \(\mathit{MSE} = 5,589.90\), \(p = .004\), \(\hat{\eta}^2_G = .014\), BF10 = 8.55. the good-other condition (734 ± 158) didn't differ from neutral-other condition (735 ±160), t(55) = -0.07, p = 0.946, Cohen's \emph{d} = -0.009, 95\% CI {[}-0.271 -0.293{]}, BF10 = 0.15, but faster than the bad other condition (776 ± 173), \emph{t}(55) = -3.14, \emph{p} = 0.0027, Cohen's \emph{d} = -0.419, 95\% CI {[}-0.691 -0.144{]}, BF10 = 11.3. The neutral-other condition also faster than the bad-other condition, \emph{t}(55) = -3.232, \emph{p} = 0.0021, Cohen's \emph{d} = -0.432, 95\% CI {[}-0.704 -0.156{]}, BF10 = 14.3.

We also analyzed the effect of self-relevance on the different moral valence levels. The results showed that for all three different valence levels, there the self condition was responded slower than other condition: good-self vs.~good-stranger, \emph{t}(55) = 4.29, \emph{p} \textless{} 0.001, Cohen's \emph{d} = 0.573, 95\% CI {[}0.288 0.854{]}, BF10 = 297.2; neutral-self vs.~neutral -stranger, \emph{t}(55) = 7.17, \emph{p} \textless{} 0.001, Cohen's \emph{d} = 0.958, 95\% CI {[}0.638 1.272{]}), BF10 = 5.77e+6; bad-self vs.~bad-other, \emph{t}(55) = 6.03, \emph{p} \textless{} 0.001, Cohen's \emph{d} = 0.806, 95\% CI {[}0.5 1.11{]}, BF10 = 100208.03.

\hypertarget{discussion-3}{%
\subsection{Discussion}\label{discussion-3}}

In experiment 3b, we separated the self-referential and other-referential tasks into different blocks so that participants had lower cognitive load when finish the task. We replicated the pattern from experiment 3a that the valence effect is stronger when the stimuli were self-referential. Contrast to experiment 3a, however, we found that the self-referential condition is out-performed by other-referential conditions. This pattern suggest that the self-referential enhanced the valence effect, and the advantage to self is relative instead of absolute.

\hypertarget{experiment-4a}{%
\section{Experiment 4a}\label{experiment-4a}}

In study 1-3 participants made explicit judgements about moral associations. In Experiment 4, we examined whether the effects of moral valence occur even when the moral valence information might not be relevent to the task. In this study participants made perceptual match judgements to associations between self-referential labels and shapes (cf.~Sui et al., 2012), but we presented labels of different moral valence levels in the shapes.

\hypertarget{participants-6}{%
\subsubsection{Participants}\label{participants-6}}

64 participants (37 female, age = 19.70 \(\pm\) 1.22) participated the current study, 32 of them were from Tsinghua Universtiy in 2015, 32 were from Wenzhou University parpticipated in 2017. All participants were right-handed, and all had normalneutral or corrected-to-normalneutral vision. Informed consent was obtained from all participants prior to the experiment according to procedures approved by a local ethics committee. The data from 5 participants from Wenzhou site were excluded from analysis because their accuracy was close to chance (\textless{} 0.6). The results for the remaining 59 participants (33 female, age = 19.78 \(\pm\) 1.20) were analyzed and reported.

\hypertarget{experimental-design}{%
\subsubsection{Experimental design}\label{experimental-design}}

As in Experiment 3, a 2× 3× 2 within-subject design was used. The first variable was self-relevance (self and stranger associations); the second variable was moral valence (good, normalneutral and bad associations); the third variable was the matching between shape and label (matching vs.~non-match for the personal association).
However, in this the task, participants only learn the association between two geometric shapes and two labels (self and other), i.e., only self-relevance were related to the task. The moral valence manipulation was achieved by embeding the personal label of the labels in the geometric shapes, see below. For simplicity, the trials where shapes where paired with self and with a word of \enquote{good person} inside were shorted as good-self condition, similarly, the trials where shapes paired with the self and with a word of \enquote{bad person} inside were shorted as bad-self condition. Hence, we also have six conditions: good-self, neutral-self, bad-self, good-other, neutral-other, and bad-other.

\hypertarget{stimuli-1}{%
\subsubsection{Stimuli}\label{stimuli-1}}

2 shapes were included (circle, square) and each appeared above a central fixation cross with the personal label appearing below. However, the shapes were not empty but with a two-Chinese-character word in the middle, the word was one of three labels with different moral valence: \enquote{good person}, \enquote{bad person} and \enquote{neutral person}. Before the experiment, participants learned the self/other association, and were informed to only response to the association between shapes' configure and the labels below the fixation, but ignore the words within shapes. Besides the behavioral experiments, participants from Tsinghua community also finished questionnaires as Experiments 3, and participants from Wenzhou community finished a series of questionnaire as the other experiment finished in Wenzhou.

\hypertarget{procedure-6}{%
\subsubsection{Procedure}\label{procedure-6}}

The procedure was similar to Experiment 1. There were 6 blocks of trial, each with 120 trials for 2017 data. Due to procedure error, the data collected in 2015 in Tsinghua community only have 60 trials for each block, i.e., 30 trials per condition.

We conducted 2 (Matchness: match v. mismatch) by 2 (Idenity: self v. other) by 3 (morlaity: good, neutral, bad) repeated measure ANOVA:

There was a main effect of Matchness (\(F(1, 58) = 79.85\), \(\mathit{MSE} = 4,817.48\), \(p < .001\), \(\hat{\eta}^2_G = .123\)) and intercation between Matchness and Identity(\(F(1, 58) = 81.15\), \(\mathit{MSE} = 3,226.69\), \(p < .001\), \(\hat{\eta}^2_G = .087\))

We carried out two separate ANOVA for both matched and mismatched trials.

For matched trials, we found the effect of identity \(F(1, 58) = 124.15\), \(\mathit{MSE} = 4,037.53\), \(p < .001\), \(\hat{\eta}^2_G = .257\), and the interaction between morality and identity,\(F(1.9, 110.18) = 4.41\), \(\mathit{MSE} = 465.91\), \(p = .016\), \(\hat{\eta}^2_G = .003\). However, there is no main effect of valence (\(F(1.98, 114.82) = 0.94\), \(\mathit{MSE} = 606.30\), \(p = .392\), \(\hat{\eta}^2_G = .001\)).

In study 4b we further investigated whether the effects of moral valence would modulate by the presence of self. In this study, participants made perceptual match judgements to associations between different moral valence and shapes as in study 1-3. However, as in study 4, we made the self-referential task as an implicit task, to examine the interaction between self-referential effect and modulation of positive moral valence.

In experiment 4, we manipulated the task so that the moral valence (experiment 4a) or the self-relatedness (experiment 4b) become irrelevant to the task. We found a robust effect of the task: when the self-relatedness is task related, the results showed a strong effect of self-relatedness; in contrast, when moral valence become task related the main effect of moral valence was strong. However, the task irrelevant stimuli in the shape exerted influence on the performance as well. The good self conditions (the shape associated the self and with a \enquote{good person} within the shape) performed better than bad self conditions. These results demonstrated that even when the moral valence and self-reference was separated by the task, participants can still couple the the self with the morally good, and facilitated the perceptual decision making.

So far, we have considered the modulation effect of morality and found that the positive moral valence could enhance the perception. However, we still not sure whether this effect was moral specific or reflecting a more general mechanism of effect of positive valence. To test the specificity of morality, we conducted experiment 5, in which three more categories of stimuli were used (people of different attractiveness, scene of diffenent attractivness, and emotional words with different valence). In this study, participants finished 4 session of association task, each with different categories of stimuli.

We conducted 4 (task type: morality, emotion, person, scene) by 3 (morlaity: good, neutral, bad) repeated measure ANOVA. The results revealed no effect of task type (\(F(2.95, 108.97) = 1.18\), \(\mathit{MSE} = 0.76\), \(p = .321\), \(\hat{\eta}^2_G = .006\)), but revealed effect of valence, \(F(1.85, 68.49) = 29.70\), \(\mathit{MSE} = 0.29\), \(p < .001\), \(\hat{\eta}^2_G = .034\), and their interactions, \(F(4.68, 173.09) = 5.85\), \(\mathit{MSE} = 0.31\), \(p < .001\), \(\hat{\eta}^2_G = .019\).

To understand the interaction, we separated four different tasks. For the morality task, the valence effect \(F(1.96, 72.66) = 2.22\), \(\mathit{MSE} = 0.21\), \(p = .116\), \(\hat{\eta}^2_G = .008\).

Post-hoc comparison showed that good (2.13, s.e. = 0.161) was not different from neutral condition (2.10, se = 0.125), \emph{t}(37) = 0.163, \emph{p} = 0.9854, but both are higher than than bad condition (1.79, se = 0.148) (neutral \textgreater{} bad, \emph{t}(37) = 3.588, \emph{p} = 0.0027; good \textgreater{} bad, \emph{t}(37) = 2.62, \emph{p} = 0.0332).

For the person appearance, the main effect of valence is significant, \(F(1.73, 64.02) = 27.22\), \(\mathit{MSE} = 0.26\), \(p < .001\), \(\hat{\eta}^2_G = .088\). Post-hoc analysis found that good condition (2.4, se = 0.167) was higher than both neutral (1.71, se = 0.175, \emph{t}(37) = 5.482, \emph{p} \textless{} .0001) and bad (1.70, se = 0.182, \emph{t}(37) = 6.365, \emph{p} \textless{} .0001), but neutral and bad condition are not different (\emph{t}(37) = 0.197, \emph{p} =0.9788).

For scene appearance, the main effect of valence is significnat \(F(1.79, 66.4) = 14.02\), \(\mathit{MSE} = 0.34\), \(p < .001\), \(\hat{\eta}^2_G = .072\). Post-hoc analysis revealed the same pattern as in person task: good condition (2.23, se = 0.156) is higher than both neutral (1.57, se = 0.178, \emph{t}(37) =4.683, \emph{p} = 0.0001) and bad (1.77, se = 0.148, \emph{t}(37) = 3.414, \emph{p} = 0.0044), but neutral and bad conditions are not different (\emph{t}(37) = -1.893, \emph{p} = 0.1549)

\hypertarget{reaction-time}{%
\subsubsection{Reaction time}\label{reaction-time}}

As in previous experiment, we focused our analysis on the matched trials. We conducted 4 (task type: morality, emotion, beauty of person, beauty of scene) by 3 (Valence: good, neutral, bad) repeated measure ANOVA for matched trials only.

We din't found the main effect of task type (\(F(2.06, 76.12) = 0.56\), \(\mathit{MSE} = 7,041.60\), \(p = .577\), \(\hat{\eta}^2_G = .004\)), but the main effect of valence (\(F(1.82, 67.23) = 53.98\), \(\mathit{MSE} = 1,911.31\), \(p < .001\), \(\hat{\eta}^2_G = .076\)), and intercation between Matchness and Valence (\(F(3.58, 132.31) = 3.12\), \(\mathit{MSE} = 2,663.50\), \(p = .021\), \(\hat{\eta}^2_G = .013\)). We then analyze the effect of valence for each task type. We found that for all four task, the valence effect was significant: morality (\(F(1.89, 69.98) = 8.66\), \(\mathit{MSE} = 1,875.36\), \(p = .001\), \(\hat{\eta}^2_G = .036\)), emotion (\(F(1.48, 54.68) = 9.74\), \(\mathit{MSE} = 2,664.24\), \(p = .001\), \(\hat{\eta}^2_G = .072\)), person (\(F(1.78, 65.78) = 39.39\), \(\mathit{MSE} = 1,310.51\), \(p < .001\), \(\hat{\eta}^2_G = .162\)), scene (\(F(1.75, 64.69) = 17.71\), \(\mathit{MSE} = 1,820.73\), \(p < .001\), \(\hat{\eta}^2_G = .102\)). Post-hoc analyses revealed that for emotion task, the good condition is reacted faster than bad condition (\emph{t}(37) = 3.475, \emph{p} = 0.0037) but not neutral conditions are not different ((\emph{t}(37) = -0.77, \emph{p} = 0.7236)). The bad condiiton is longer than the neutral (\emph{t}(37) = 5.09, \emph{p} \textless{} 0.0001). The pattern is different for morality, person, and scence tasks, which showed that good is faster than both neutral ((\emph{ts}(37) = {[}-7.289 -2.4{]}, \emph{ps} \textless{} 0.0548)) and bad (\emph{ts}(37) = {[}-7.232 -3.817{]}, \emph{ps} \textless{} 0.0014).

\subsubsection{Participants}\label{participants-9}}

25 college students (8 female, age = 22.72 \(\pm\) 2.84) participated the current study, all of them were from Tsinghua Universtiy in 2014. Informed consent was obtained from all participants prior to the experiment according to procedures approved by a local ethics committee. No participant was excluded from behavioral analysis.

\hypertarget{experimental-design-3}{%
\subsubsection{Experimental design}\label{experimental-design-3}}

The experimental design of this experiment is same as experiment 2: a 3 × 2 within-subject design with moral valence (good, neutral and bad associations) and matchness between shape and label (match vs.~mismatch for the personal association) as within-subject variables.

\hypertarget{stimuli-4}{%
\subsubsection{Stimuli}\label{stimuli-4}}

Three geometric shapes (triangle, square and circle, each 4.6º × 4.6º of visual angle) were presented at the center of screen for 50 ms after 500ms of fixation (0.8º × 0.8º of visual angle). The association of the three shapes to bad person (\enquote{坏人, HuaiRen}), good person (\enquote{好人, HaoRen}) or ordinary person (\enquote{常人, ChangRen}) was counterbalanced across participants. The words bad person, good person or ordinary person (3.6º × 1.6º) was also displayed at the center fo the screen. Participants had to judge whether the pairings of label and shape matched (e.g., Does the circle represent a bad person?). The experiment was run on a PC using E-prime software (version 2.0). These stimuli were displayed on a 22-in CRT monitor (1024×768 at 100Hz).
We used backward masking to avoid over-processing of the moral words, in which a scrabmled picture were presented for 900 ms after the label. Also, to avoid the celling effect on accruacy, shapes were presented on a noisy background based on our pilot studies. The noisy images were made by scrambling a picutre of 3/4gray and ¼ white at resoluation of 2 × 2 pixel.

\hypertarget{procedure-9}{%
\subsubsection{Procedure}\label{procedure-9}}

The procedure was similar to Experiment 2. Participants finished 6 blocks of trial, each with 180 trials. In total, participants finished 180 trials for each combination of condition.

As in experiment 2 (Sui, He, \& Humphreys, 2012), subjects first learned the associations between labels and shapes and then completed a shape-label matching task (e.g., good person-triangle). In each trial of the matching task, a fixation were first presented for 500 ms, followed by a 50 ms label; then, a scramled picture presented 900 ms. After the backward mask, the shape were presented on a noisy background for 50ms. Participant have to response in 1000ms after the presentation of the shape, and finnally, a feedback screen was presented for 500 ms (see figure 1). The inter-trial interval (ITI) were randomly varied at the range of 1000 \textasciitilde{} 1400 ms.

All the stimuli were presented on a gray background (RGB: 127, 127, 127). E-primed 2.0 was used to present stimuli and collect behavioral results. Data were collected and analyzed when accuracy performance in total reached 60\%.

\hypertarget{d-prime-2}{%
\subsubsection{\texorpdfstring{\emph{d} prime}{d prime}}\label{d-prime-2}}

We conducted repeated measures ANOVA, with moral valence as independent variable. The results revealed the main effect of valence (\(F(1.73, 41.45) = 4.63\), \(\mathit{MSE} = 0.10\), \(p = .019\), \(\hat{\eta}^2_G = .025\)). Post-hoc anlaysis revealed that shapes link with Good person (mean = 3.13, SE = 0.109) is greater than Neutral condition (mean = 2.88, SE = 0.14),\emph{t} = 2.916, \emph{df} = 24, \emph{p} = 0.02, p-value adjusted by Tukey method, but the \emph{d} prime between Good and bad (mean = 3.03, SE = 0.142) (\emph{t} = 1.512, \emph{df} = 24, \emph{p} = 0.3034, p-value adjusted by Tukey method), bad and neutral (\emph{t} = 1.599, \emph{df} = 24, \emph{p} = 0.2655, p-value adjusted by Tukey method) were not siginificant.

\hypertarget{analaysis-of-reaction-time.-5}{%
\subsubsection{Analaysis of reaction time.}\label{analaysis-of-reaction-time.-5}}

The results of reaction times of matchness trials showed similiar pattern as the \emph{d} prime data.

We found intercation between Matchness and Valence (\(F(1.96, 47.14) = 21.88\), \(\mathit{MSE} = 434.43\), \(p < .001\), \(\hat{\eta}^2_G = .021\)) and then analyzed the matched trials and mismatched trials separately, as in experiment 2. For matched trials, we found the effect of valence \(F(1.98, 47.44) = 34.68\), \(\mathit{MSE} = 511.80\), \(p < .001\), \(\hat{\eta}^2_G = .080\). For non-matched trials, there was no significant effect of Valence (\(F(1.78, 42.78) = 0.42\), \(\mathit{MSE} = 234.71\), \(p = .638\), \(\hat{\eta}^2_G = .000\)). Post-hoc \emph{t}-tests revealed that shapes associated with Good Person (mean = 550, SE = 13.8) were responded faster than Neutral-Person (501, SE = 14.7), (\emph{t}(24) = -5.171, \emph{p} = 0.0001) and Bad Person (523, SE = 16.3), \emph{t}(24) = -8.137, \emph{p} \textless{} 0.0001)., and Neutral is faster than Bad-Person condition (\emph{t}(32) = -3.282, \emph{p} = 0.0085).

23 college students (8 female, age = 22.86 \(\pm\) 2.47) participated the current study, all of them were recruited from Tsinghua Universtiy in 2016. Informed consent was obtained from all participants prior to the experiment according to procedures approved by a local ethics committee. For day 1's data, 1 participant was excluded from the current analysis because of lower than 60\% overall accuracy.22 college students (8 female, age = 22.76 \(\pm\) 2.49). For day 2's data, one participant dropp out , and leaving 22 participants (9 female, age = 23.05 \(\pm\) 2.46) in day 2, all of them has overall accuracy higher than 60\%.

\hypertarget{experimental-design-4}{%
\subsubsection{Experimental design}\label{experimental-design-4}}

The experimental design of this experiment is same as experiment 3: a 2 × 3 × 2 within-subject design with self-relevance (self-relevant vs.~other-relevant), moral valence (good, neutral and bad associations) and matchness between shape and label (match vs.~mismatch for the personal association) as within-subject variables.

\hypertarget{stimuli-5}{%
\subsubsection{Stimuli}\label{stimuli-5}}

As in experiment 3 a \& 3b, 6 shapes were included (triangle, square, circle, trapezoid, diamond, regular pentagon), as well as 6 labels (good self, neutral self, bad self, good person, bad person, neutral person). To match the concreteness of the label, we asked participant to chosen an unfamiliar name of their own gender to be the stranger.

\hypertarget{procedure-10}{%
\subsubsection{Procedure}\label{procedure-10}}

The procedure was similar to Experiment 2 and 6b. Subjects first learned the associations between labels and shapes and then completed a shape-label matching task. In each trial of the matching task, a fixation were first presented for 500 ms, followed by a 50 ms label; then, a scramled picture presented 900 ms. After the backward mask, the shape were presented on a noisy background for 50ms. Participant have to response in 1000ms after the presentation of the shape, and finnally, a feedback screen was presented for 500 ms (see figure 1). The inter-trial interval (ITI) were randomly varied at the range of 1000 \textasciitilde{} 1400 ms.

All the stimuli were presented on a gray background (RGB: 127, 127, 127). E-primed 2.0 was used to present stimuli and collect behavioral results. Data were collected and analyzed when accuracy performance in total reached 60\%.

Given that learning 6 association is more difficult than 3 association and participant has low accuracy at the begining, to maximizing the accurate trials that can be used in EEG data, the current experiment has two day session. At the first day, participants learnt the associations and finished XX blocks of the matching task, each had XX trials, without EEG recording. They came back to lab at the second day and finish the same task again, with EEG recorded.
