\hypertarget{participants}{%
\subsubsection{Participants}\label{participants}}

57 college students (38 female, age = 20.75 \(\pm\) 2.54 years) participated. 39 of them were recruited from Tsinghua University community in 2014; 18 were recruited from Wenzhou University in 2017. All participants were right-handed except one, and all had normal or corrected-to-normal vision. Informed consent was obtained from all participants prior to the experiment according to procedures approved by the local ethics committees. 6 participant's data were excluded from analysis because nearly random level of accuracy, leaving 51 participants (34 female, age = 20.72 \(\pm\) 2.44 years).

\hypertarget{stimuli-and-tasks}{%
\subsubsection{Stimuli and Tasks}\label{stimuli-and-tasks}}

Three geometric shapes were used in this experiment: triangle, square, and circle. These shapes were paired with three labels (bad person, good person or neutral person). The pairs were counterbalanced across participants.

\hypertarget{procedure}{%
\subsubsection{Procedure}\label{procedure}}

As we describe in general method part, this experiment had two phases. First, there was a learning stage. Participants were asked to learn the relationship between geometric shapes (triangle, square, and circle) and different person (bad person, a good person, or a neutral person). For example, a participant was told, \enquote{bad person is a circle; good person is a triangle; and a neutral person is represented by a square.} After participant remember the associations (usually in a few minutes), participants started a practicing phase of matching task which has the exact task as in the experimental task.
In the experimental task, participants judged whether shape--label pairs, which were subsequently presented, were correct. Each trial started with the presentation of a central fixation cross for 500 ms. Subsequently, a pairing of a shape and label (good person, bad person, and neutral person) was presented for 100 ms. The pair presented could confirm to the verbal instruction for each pairing given in the training stage, or it could be a recombination of a shape with a different label, with the shape--label pairings being generated at random. The next frame showed a blank for 1100ms. Participants were expected to judge whether the shape was correctly assigned to the person by pressing one of the two response buttons as quickly and accurately as possible within this timeframe (to encourage immediate responding). Feedback (correct or incorrect) was given on the screen for 500 ms at the end of each trial, if no response detected, \enquote{too slow} was presented to remind participants to accelerate. Participants were informed of their overall accuracy at the end of each block. The practice phase finished and the experimental task began after the overall performance of accuracy during practice phase achieved 60\%.
For participants from the Tsinghua community, they completed 6 experimental blocks of 60 trials. Thus, there were 60 trials in each condition (bad-person match, bad-person nonmatch, good-person match, good-person nonmatch, neutral-person match, and neutral-person nonmatch). For the participants from Wenzhou University, they finished 6 blocks of 120 trials, therefore, 120 trials for each condition.

\hypertarget{data-analysis}{%
\subsubsection{Data analysis}\label{data-analysis}}

As we describe in the general method section, we used three different approaches to analyze the data: classical NHST approach, i.e., the repeated measures ANOVA and post-hoc comparisons in our cases, Bayesian generalized linear model (GLM) approach where we used hierarchical modeling approach, and the hierarchical drift diffusion model (HDDM).

We analyzed accuracy performance using a signal detection theory approach. The performance in each match condition was combined with that in the nonmatch condition with the same shape to form a measure of \(d'\), the match trials were regarded as signal while the nonmatch trials were regarded as noise (Sui, He, \& Humphreys, 2012). Given that the match and nonmatch trials are presented in the same way and had same number of trials across all studies, we assume that participants' inner distribution of these two types of trials had equal variance but may had different means. That is, we used the equal variance Gaussian SDT model (EVSDT) here (Rouder \& Lu, 2005). \textbf{Trials without response were excluded from the analysis.}

\hypertarget{classic-nhst}{%
\paragraph{Classic NHST}\label{classic-nhst}}

In the classic NHST approach, we've used the maximum likelihood estimate of the EVSDT parameters (mainly, the sensitivity \(d'\)) separately for each participant in the each experiment condition (Hu, Lan, Macrae, \& Sui, 2020; Sui et al., 2012), and then used the parameter of each condition from each participant as dependent variable for repeated measures ANOVA. The \(d'\) is calculated as the difference of the standardized hit and false alarm rats (Stanislaw \& Todorov, 1999):
\[ d' = zHR - zFAR = \Phi^{-1}(HR) - \Phi^{-1}(FAR) \]
where the \(HR\) means hit rate and the \(FAR\) mean false alarm rate. \(zHR\) and \(zFAR\) are the standardized hit rate and false alarm rates, respectively. These two \(z\)-scores were converted from proportion (i.e., hit rate or false alarm rate) by inverse cumulative normal density function, \(\Phi^{-1}\) (\(\Phi\) is the cumulative normal density function, and is used convert \(z\) score into probabilities). Another parameter of signal detection theory, response criterion \(c\), is defined by the negative standardized false alarm rate (DeCarlo, 1998): \(-zFAR\).

For the RTs, we used mean RTs of the accurate trials of each condition and subject for repeated measures ANOVA.

\hypertarget{bayesian-generalized-modelling}{%
\paragraph{Bayesian generalized modelling}\label{bayesian-generalized-modelling}}

The maximum likelihood estimate of parameters of EVSDT may ignored the uncertainty in estimates of the parameters (Rouder \& Lu, 2005). Bayesian generalized linear model (GLM) can help to estimate the uncertainty of parameters. We used BRMs (Bürkner, 2017; Carpenter et al., 2017) to model the data.

In the GLM model, we assume that the outcome of each trial is Bernoulli distributed (binomial with 1 trial), with probability \(p_{i}\) that \(y_{i} = 1\).

\[ y_{i} \sim Bernoulli(p_{i})\]
In the perceptual matching task, the probability \(p_{i}\) can then be modeled as a function of the trial type:

\[ \Phi(p_{i}) =  \beta_{0} + \beta_{1}IsMatch_{i}\]
The outcomes \(y_{i}\) are 0 if the participant responded \enquote{nonmatch} on trial \(i\), 1 if they responded \enquote{match}. The probability of the \enquote{match} response for trial \(i\) for a participant is \(p_{i}\). We then write the generalized linear model on the probits (z-scores; \(\Phi\), \enquote{Phi}) of \(p\)s. \(\Phi\) is the cumulative normal density function and maps \(z\) scores to probabilities. Given this parameterization, the intercept of the model (\(\beta_0\)) is the standardized false alarm rate (probability of saying 1 when predictor is 0), which we take as our criterion \(c\). The slope of the model (\(\beta_1\)) is the increase of saying 1 when predictor is 1, in \(z\)-scores, which is another expression of \(d'\). Therefore, \(c\) = -\(z\)HR = \(-\beta_0\), and \(d' = \beta_1\).

In each experiment, we had multiple participants, then we need also consider the variations between subjects, i.e., a hierarchical mode in which individual's parameter and the the population level parameter are estimated simultaneously. We assume that the outcome of each trial is Bernoulli distributed (binomial with 1 trial), with probability \(p_{ij}\) that \(y_{ij} = 1\).

\[ y_{ij} \sim Bernoulli(p_{ij})\]
Similarly, the generalized linear model was extended to two levels:
\[ \Phi(p_{ij}) =  \beta_{0j} + \beta_{1j}IsMatch_{ij}\]
The outcomes \(y_{ij}\) are 0 if participant \(j\) responded \enquote{nonmatch} on trial \(i\), 1 if they responded \enquote{match}. The probability of the \enquote{match} response for trial \(i\) for subject \(j\) is \(p_{ij}\). We again can write the generalized linear model on the probits (z-scores; \(\Phi\), \enquote{Phi}) of \(p\)s.

The subjective-specific intercepts (\(\beta_{0} = -zFAR\)) and slopes (\(\beta_{1} = d'\)) are describe by multivariate normal with means and a covariance matrix for the parameters.
\[ \begin{bmatrix}\beta_{0j}\\
\beta_{1j}\\
\end{bmatrix} \sim N(\begin{bmatrix}\theta_{0}\\
\theta_{1}\\
\end{bmatrix}, \sum) \]

In the same vein, when trying to estimate the parameter across different experiments, we can further consider the participant is nested in different experiments, and each experiment, because of its variation in stimuli or stimuli presentation, may have different intercepts and slopes. In this case, we can use a nested hierarchical model to model all the experiment with similar design:
\[y_{ijk} \sim Bernoulli(p_{ijk})\]
where
\[ \Phi(p_{ijk}) =  \beta_{0jk} + \beta_{1jk}IsMatch_{ijk}\]
The outcomes \(y_{ijk}\) are 0 if participant \(j\) in experiment k responded \enquote{nonmatch} on trial \(i\), 1 if they responded \enquote{match}.

\[\begin{bmatrix}\beta_{0jk}\\
\beta_{1jk}\\
\end{bmatrix} \sim N(\begin{bmatrix}\theta_{0k}\\
\theta_{1k}\\
\end{bmatrix}, \sum)\]

and the experiment level parameter \(mu_{0k}\) and \(mu_{1k}\) is from a higher order distribution:

\[\begin{bmatrix}\theta_{0k}\\
\theta_{1k}\\
\end{bmatrix} \sim N(\begin{bmatrix}\mu_{0}\\
\mu_{1}\\
\end{bmatrix}, \sum)\]
in which \(\mu_{0}\) and \(\mu_{1}\) means the population level parameter.

Using the Bayesian hierarchical model, we can directly estimate the over-all effect of valence on \(d'\) across all experiments with similar experimental design, instead of using a two-step approach where we first estimate the \(d'\) for each participant and then use a random effect model meta-analysis (Goh, Hall, \& Rosenthal, 2016).

For the reaction time, there are many criticism about using the mean RTs as the representation of each participant (Rousselet \& Wilcox, 2019), to better capture a representative parameter for RTs, we used the log normal distribution (\url{https://lindeloev.github.io/shiny-rt/\#34_(shifted)_log-normal}). This distribution has two parameters: \(\mu\), \(\sigma\). \(\mu\) is the mean of the logNormal distribution, and \(\sigma\) is the disperse of the distribution. The log normal distribution can be extended to shifted log normal distribution, with one more parameter: shift, which is the earliest possible response.

\[y_{i} = \beta_{0} + \beta_{1}*IsMatch_{i} * Valence_{i}\]

Shifted log-normal distribution:
\[ log(y_{ij}) \sim N(\mu_{j}, \sigma_{j})\]
\(y_{ij}\) is the RT of the \(i\)th trial of the \(j\)th participants.

\[\mu_{j} \sim N(\mu, \sigma)\]

\[\sigma_{j} \sim Cauchy()\]

This model can be easily expand to three-level model in which participants and experiments are two group level variable and participants were nested in the experiments.
\[ log(y_{ijk}) \sim N(\mu_{jk}, \sigma_{jk})\]

\(y_{ijk}\) is the RT of the \(i\)th trial of the \(j\)th participants in the \(k\)th experiment.

\[\mu_{jk} \sim N(\mu_{k}, \sigma_{k})\]

\[\sigma_{jk} \sim Cauchy()\]

\[\theta_{jk} \sim Cauchy()\]

\[\mu_{k} \sim N(\mu, \sigma)\]

\hypertarget{hierarchical-drift-diffusion-model-hddm}{%
\paragraph{Hierarchical drift diffusion model (HDDM)}\label{hierarchical-drift-diffusion-model-hddm}}

To further explore the psychological mechanism under perceptual decision-making, we used HDDM (Wiecki, Sofer, \& Frank, 2013) to model our RTs and accuracy data. We used the prior implemented in HDDM, that is, informative priors that constrains parameter estimates to be in the range of plausible values based on past literature (Matzke \& Wagenmakers, 2009)

Figure \ref{fig:ex1a-dprime-rt} shows \emph{d} prime and reaction times during the perceptual matching task. We conducted a single factor (valence: good, neutral, bad) repeated measure ANOVA.

We found the effect of Valence (\(F(1.96, 97.84) = 6.19\), \(\mathit{MSE} = 0.27\), \(p = .003\), \(\hat{\eta}^2_G = .020\)). The post-hoc comparison with multiple comparison correction revealed that the shapes associated with Good-person (2.11, SE = 0.14) has greater \emph{d} prime than shapes associated with Bad-person (1.75, SE = 0.14), \emph{t}(50) = 3.304, \emph{p} = 0.0049. The Good-person condition was also greater than the Neutral-person condition (1.95, SE = 0.16), but didn't reach statistical significant, \emph{t}(50) = 1.54, \emph{p} = 0.28. Neither the Neutral-person condition is significantly greater than the Bad-person condition, \emph{t}(50) = 2.109, \emph{p} = .098.

\hypertarget{reaction-times}{%
\paragraph{Reaction times}\label{reaction-times}}

We conducted 2 (Matchness: match v. nonmatch) by 3 (Valence: good, neutral, bad) repeated measure ANOVA. We found the main effect of Matchness (\(F(1, 50) = 232.39\), \(\mathit{MSE} = 948.92\), \(p < .001\), \(\hat{\eta}^2_G = .104\)), main effect of valence (\(F(1.87, 93.31) = 9.62\), \(\mathit{MSE} = 1,673.86\), \(p < .001\), \(\hat{\eta}^2_G = .016\)), and interaction between Matchness and Valence (\(F(1.73, 86.65) = 8.52\), \(\mathit{MSE} = 1,441.75\), \(p = .001\), \(\hat{\eta}^2_G = .011\)).

We then carried out two separate ANOVA for Match and Mismatched trials. For matched trials, we found the effect of valence . We further examined the effect of valence for both self and other for matched trials. We found that shapes associated with Good Person (684 ms, SE = 11.5) responded faster than Neutral (709 ms, SE = 11.5), \emph{t}(50) = -2.265, \emph{p} = 0.0702) and Bad Person (728 ms, SE = 11.7), \emph{t}(50) = -4.41, \emph{p} = 0.0002), and the Neutral condition was faster than the Bad condition, \emph{t}(50) = -2.495, \emph{p} = 0.0415). For non-matched trials, there was no significant effect of Valence ().

\hypertarget{d-prime-1}{%
\paragraph{\texorpdfstring{\emph{d} prime}{d prime}}\label{d-prime-1}}

We fitted a Bayesian hierarchical GLM for signal detection theory approach. The results showed that when the shapes were tagged with labels with different moral valence, the sensitivity (\(d'\)) and criteria (\(c\)) were both influence. For the \(d'\), we found that the shapes tagged with morally good person (2.46, 95\% CI{[}2.21 2.72{]}) is greater than shapes tagged with moral bad (2.07, 95\% CI{[}1.83 2.32{]}), \(P_{PosteriorComparison} = 1\). Shape tagged with morally good person is also greater than shapes tagged with neutral person (2.23, 95\% CI{[}1.95 2.49{]}), \(P_{PosteriorComparison} = 0.97\). Also, the shapes tagged with neutral person is greater than shapes tagged with morally bad person, \(P_{PosteriorComparison} = 0.92\).

Interesting, we also found the criteria for three conditions also differ, the shapes tagged with good person has the highest criteria (-1.01, {[}-1.14 -0.88{]}), followed by shapes tagged with neutral person(-1.06, {[}-1.21 -0.92{]}), and then the shapes tagged with bad person(-1.11, {[}-1.25 -0.97{]}). However, pair-wise comparison showed that only showed strong evidence for the difference between good and bad conditions.

\hypertarget{reaction-times-1}{%
\paragraph{Reaction times}\label{reaction-times-1}}

\includegraphics{Suppl_Materials_individual_Exp_files/figure-latex/1a_rt_BGLM-1.pdf}
We fitted a Bayesian hierarchical GLM for RTs, with a log-normal distribution as the link function. We used the posterior distribution of the regression coefficient to make statistical inferences. As in previous studies, the matched conditions are much faster than the mismatched trials (\(P_{PosteriorComparison} = 1\)). We focused on matched trials only, and compared different conditions: Good is faster than the neutral, \(P_{PosteriorComparison} = .99\), it was also faster than the Bad condition, \(P_{PosteriorComparison} = 1\). And the neutral condition is faster than the bad condition, \(P_{PosteriorComparison} = .99\). However, the mismatched trials are largely overlapped.

\hypertarget{hddm}{%
\subsubsection{HDDM}\label{hddm}}

We fitted our data with HDDM, using the response-coding {[}also see Hu\_2020\_GoodSelf{]}. We estimated separate drift rate (\(v\)), non-decision time (\(T_{0}\)), and boundary separation (\(a\)) for each condition. We found that the shapes tagged with good person has higher drift rate and higher boundary separation than shapes tagged with both neutral and bad person. Also, the shapes tagged with neutral person has a higher drift rate than shapes tagged with bad person, but not for the boundary separation. Finally, we found that shapes tagged with bad person had longer non-decision time (see figure ).

72 college students (49 female, age = 20.17 \(\pm\) 2.08 years) participated. 39 of them were recruited from Tsinghua University community in 2014; 33 were recruited from Wenzhou University in 2017. All participants were right-handed except one, and all had normal or corrected-to-normal vision. Informed consent was obtained from all participants prior to the experiment according to procedures approved by the local ethics committees. 20 participant's data were excluded from analysis because nearly random level of accuracy, leaving 52 participants (36 female, age = 20.25 \(\pm\) 2.31 years).

\hypertarget{stimuli-and-tasks-1}{%
\subsubsection{Stimuli and Tasks}\label{stimuli-and-tasks-1}}

Three geometric shapes (triangle, square, and circle, with 3.7º × 3.7º of visual angle) were presented above a white fixation cross subtending 0.8º × 0.8º of visual angle at the center of the screen. The three shapes were randomly assigned to three labels with different moral valence: a morally bad person (\enquote{恶人}, ERen), a morally good person (\enquote{善人}, ShanRen) or a morally neutral person (\enquote{常人}, ChangRen). The order of the associations between shapes and labels was counterbalanced across participants.
Three labels used in this experiment is selected based on the rating results from an independent survey, in which participants rated the familiarity, frequency, and concreteness of eight different words online. Of the eight words, three of them are morally positive (HaoRen, ShanRen, Junzi), two of them are morally neutral (ChangRen, FanRen), and three of them are morally negative (HuaiRen, ERen, LiuMang). An independent sample consist of 35 participants (22 females, age 20.6 ± 3.11) were recruited to rate these words. Based on the ratings (see supplementary materials Figure S1), we selected ShanRen, ChangRen, and ERen to represent morally positve, neutral, and negative person.

\hypertarget{procedure-1}{%

For participants from both Tsinghua community and Wenzhou community, the procedure in the current study was exactly same as in experiment 1a. For participants in Tsinghua community, they finished a survey suite include personal distance, objective and subjective SES, belief in just world (Wu et al., 2011), disgust sensitivity scale (谭永红 et al., 2007), trait justice (Wu et al., 2014), and cognitive reflection test (Frederick, 2005).

Paired t test showed that the Good-Person condition (1.87 \(\pm\) 0.102) was with greater \emph{d} prime than Neutral condition (1.44 \(\pm\) 0.101, \emph{t}(51) = 5.945, \emph{p} \textless{} 0.001). We also found that the Bad-Person condition (1.67 \(\pm\) 0.11) has also greater \emph{d} prime than neutral condition , \emph{t}(51) = 3.132, \emph{p} = 0.008).

These results confirmed the facilitation effect of positive moral valence on the perceptual matching task. This pattern of results mimic prior results demonstrating self-bias effect on perceptual matching (Sui et al., 2012) and in line with previous studies that indirect learning of other's moral reputation do have influence on our subsequent behavior (Fouragnan et al., 2013).

In this study, we further control the valence of words using in our experiment. Instead of using label with moral valence, we used valence-neutral names in China. Participant first learn behaviors of the different person, then, they associate the names and shapes. And then they perform a name-shape matching task.

23 college students (15 female, age = 22.61 \(\pm\) 2.62 years) participated. All of them were recruited from Tsinghua University community in 2014. Informed consent was obtained from all participants prior to the experiment according to procedures approved by the local ethics committees. No participant was excluded because they overall accuracy were above 0.6.

\subsubsection{Stimuli and Tasks}\label{stimuli-and-tasks-2}}

Three geometric shapes (triangle, square, and circle, with 3.7º × 3.7º of visual angle) were presented above a white fixation cross subtending 0.8º × 0.8º of visual angle at the center of the screen. The three most common names were chosen, which are neutral in moral valence before the manipulation.
Three names (Zhang, Wang, Li) were first paired with three paragraphs of behavioral description. Each description includes one sentence of biographic information and four sentences that describing the moral behavioral under that name. To assess the that these three descriptions represented good, neutral, and bad valence, we collected the ratings of three person on six dimensions: morality, likability, trustworthiness, dominance, competence, and aggressiviess, from an independent sample (n = 34, 18 female, age = 19.6 ± 2.05). The rating results showed that the person with morally good behavioral description has higher score on morality (M = 3.59, SD = 0.66) than neutral (M = 0.88, SD = 1.1), \emph{t}(33) = 12.94, \emph{p} \textless{} .001, and bad conditions (M = -3.4, SD = 1.1), \emph{t}(33) = 30.78, \emph{p} \textless{} .001. Neutral condition was also significant higher than bad conditions \(t(33) = 13.9\), \(p < .001\) (See supplementary materials).

\subsubsection{Procedure}\label{procedure-2}}

After arriving the lab, participants were informed to complete two experimental tasks, first a social memory task to remember three person and their behaviors, after tested for their memory, they will finish a perceptual matching task.
In the social memory task, the descriptions of three person were presented without time limitation. Participant self-paced to memorized the behaviors of each person. After they memorizing, a recognition task was used to test their memory effect. Each participant was required to have over 95\% accuracy before preceding to matching task.
The perceptual learning task was followed, three names were randomly paired with geometric shapes. Participants were required to learn the association and perform a practicing task before they start the formal experimental blocks. They kept practicing util they reached 70\% accuracy. Then, they would start the perceptual matching task as in experiment 1a. They finished 6 blocks of perceptual matching trials, each have 120 trials.

\hypertarget{experiment-2-sequential-presenting}{%
\section{Experiment 2: Sequential presenting}\label{experiment-2-sequential-presenting}}

Experiment 2 was conducted for two purpose: (1) to further confirm the facilitation effect of positive moral associations; (2) to test the effect of expectation of occurrence of each pair. In this experiment, after participant learned the association between labels and shapes, they were presented a label first and then a shape, they then asked to judge whether the shape matched the label or not (see (Sui, Sun, Peng, \& Humphreys, 2014). Previous studies showed that when the labels presented before the shapes, participants formed expectations about the shape, and therefore a top-down process were introduced into the perceptual matching processing. If the facilitation effect of positive moral valence we found in experiment 1 was mainly drive by top-down processes, this sequential presenting paradigm may eliminate or attenuate this effect; if, however, the facilitation effect occurred because of button-up processes, then, similar facilitation effect will appear even with sequential presenting paradigm.

The results of 1 participants were excluded from analysis because of less than 60\% overall accuracy, remains 34 participants (17 female, age = 21.74 \(\pm\) 3.04).

\hypertarget{procedure-3}{%
\subsubsection{Procedure}\label{procedure-3}}

In Experiment 2, the sequential presenting makes the matching task much easier than experiment 1. To avoid ceiling effect on behavioral data, we did a few pilot experiments to get optimal parameters, i.e., the conditions under which participant have similar accuracy as in Experiment 1 (around 70 \textasciitilde{} 80\% accuracy).
In the final procedure, the label (good person, bad person, or neutral person) was presented for 50 ms and then masked by a scrambled image for 200 ms. A geometric shape followed the scrambled mask for 50 ms in a noisy background (which was produced by first decomposing a square with \(¾\) gray area and \(¼\) white area to small squares with a size of 2 × 2 pixels and then re-combine these small pieces randomly), instead of pure gray background in Experiment 1. After that, a blank screen was presented 1100 ms, during which participants should press a button to indicate the label and the shape match the original association or not. Feedback was given, as in study 1. The next trial then started after 700 \textasciitilde{} 1100 ms blank. Other aspects of study 2 were identical to study 1.

Post-hoc \emph{t}-tests revealed that shapes associated with Good Person (548 \(\pm\) 9.4) were responded faster than Neutral-Person (582 \(\pm\) 10.9), (\emph{t}(33) = -3.95, \emph{p} = 0.0011) and Bad Person (582 \(\pm\) 10.2), \emph{t}(33) = -3.9, \emph{p} = 0.0013). While there was no significant differences between Neutral and Bad-Person condition (\emph{t}(33) = -0.01, \emph{p} = 0.999). For non-matched trials, there was no significant effect of Valence (\(F(1.99, 65.83) = 0.17\), \(\mathit{MSE} = 489.80\), \(p = .843\), \(\hat{\eta}^2_G = .001\)).

\hypertarget{discussion-2}{%

In this experiment, we repeated the results pattern that the positive moral valenced stimuli has an advantage over the neutral or the negative valence association. Moreover, with a cross-task analysis, we didn't found evidence that the experiment task interacted with moral valence, suggesting that the effect might not be effect by experiment task.
These findings suggested that the facilitation effect of positive moral valence is robust and not affected by task. This robust effect detected by the associative learning is unexpected.

\hypertarget{experiment-3a}{%
\section{Experiment 3a}\label{experiment-3a}}

To examine the modulation effect of positive valence was an intrinsic, self-referential process, we designed study 3. In this study, moral valence was assigned to both self and a stranger. We hypothesized that the modulation effect of moral valence will be stronger for the self than for a stranger.

38 college students (15 female, age = 21.92 \(\pm\) 2.16) participated in experiment 3a. All of them were right-handed, and all had normal or correted-to-normal vision. Informed consent was obtained from all participants prior to the experiment according to procedures approved by a local ethics committee. One female and one male student did not finish the experiment, and 1 participants' data were excluded from analysis because less than 60\% overall accuracy, remains 35 participants (13 female, age = 22.11 \(\pm\) 2.13).

\hypertarget{design}{%
\subsubsection{Design}\label{design}}

Study 3a combined moral valence with self-relevance, hence the experiment has a 2 × 3 × 2 within-subject design. The first variable was self-relevance, include two levels: self-relevance vs.~stranger-relevance; the second variable was moral valence, include good, neutral and bad; the third variable was the matching between shape and label: match vs.~mismatch.

\hypertarget{stimuli}{%
\subsubsection{Stimuli}\label{stimuli}}

The stimuli used in study 3a share the same parameters with experiment 1 \& 2. 6 shapes were included (triangle, square, circle, trapezoid, diamond, regular pentagon), as well as 6 labels (good self, neutral self, bad self, good person, bad person, neutral person). To match the concreteness of the label, we asked participant to chosen an unfamiliar name of their own gender to be the stranger.

\hypertarget{procedure-4}{%
\subsubsection{Procedure}\label{procedure-4}}

After being fully explained and signed the informed consent, participants were instructed to chose a name that can represent a stranger with same gender as the participant themselves, from a common Chinese name pool. Before experiment, the experimenter explained the meaning of each label to participants. For example, the \enquote{good self} mean the morally good side of themselves, them could imagine the moment when they do something's morally applauded, \enquote{bad self} means the morally bad side of themselves, they could also imagine the moment when they doing something morally wrong, and \enquote{neutral self} means the aspect of self that doesn't related to morality, they could imagine the moment when they doing something irrelevant to morality. In the same sense, the \enquote{good other}, \enquote{bad other}, and \enquote{neutral other} means the three different aspects of the stranger, whose name was chosen before the experiment. Then, the experiment proceeded as study 1a. Each participant finished 6 blocks, each have 120 trials. The sequence of trials was pseudo-randomized so that there are 10 matched trials for each condition and 10 non-matched trials for each condition (good self, neutral sef, bad self, good other, neutral other, bad other) for each block.

We then conducted separated ANOVA for self-referential and other-referential trials. The valence effect was shown for the self-referential conditions, \(F(1.65, 56.25) = 13.98\), \(\mathit{MSE} = 0.31\), \(p < .001\), \(\hat{\eta}^2_G = .119\). Post-hoc test revealed that the Good-Self condition (1.97 \(\pm\) 0.14) was with greater \emph{d} prime than Netural condition (1.41 \(\pm\) 0.12, \emph{t}(34) = 4.505, \emph{p} = 0.0002), and Bad-self condition (1.43 \(\pm\) 0.102), \emph{t}(34) = 3.856, \emph{p} = 0.0014. There was difference between neutral and bad conidition, \emph{t}(34) = -0.238, \emph{p} = 0.9694.

For the matched trials, we found that the interaction between identity and valence, \(F(1.72, 58.61) = 3.89\), \(\mathit{MSE} = 2,750.19\), \(p = .032\), \(\hat{\eta}^2_G = .019\), as well as the main effect of valence \(F(1.98, 67.34) = 35.76\), \(\mathit{MSE} = 1,127.25\), \(p < .001\), \(\hat{\eta}^2_G = .079\), but not the effect of identity \(F(1, 34) = 0.20\), \(\mathit{MSE} = 3,507.14\), \(p = .660\), \(\hat{\eta}^2_G = .001\). As for the \emph{d} prime, we separated analyzed the self-referential and other-referential trials. For the Self-referential trials, we found the main effect of valence, \(F(1.80, 61.09) = 30.39\), \(\mathit{MSE} = 1,584.53\), \(p < .001\), \(\hat{\eta}^2_G = .159\); for the other-referential trials, the effect of valence is weaker, \(F(1.86, 63.08) = 2.85\), \(\mathit{MSE} = 2,224.30\), \(p = .069\), \(\hat{\eta}^2_G = .024\). We then focused on the self conditions: the good-self condition (713 \(\pm\) 12) is faster than neutral- (776 \(\pm\) 11.8), \emph{t}(34) = -7.396, \emph{p} \textless{} .0001 , and bad-self (772 \(\pm\) 10.1) conditions, \emph{t}(34) = -5.66, \emph{p} \textless{} .0001. But there is not difference between neutral- and bad-self conditions, \emph{t}(34) = 0.481, \emph{p} = 0.881.

In study 3a, participants had to remember 6 pairs of association, which cause high cognitive load during the whole experiment. To eliminate the influence of cognitive load, we conducted study 3b, in which participant learn three aspect of self and stranger separately in to consecutive task. We hypothesize that we will replicate the pattern of study 3a, i.e., the effect of moral valence only occurs for self-relevant conditions.

Study 3b were finished in 2017, at that time we have calculated that the effect size (Cohen's \(d\)) of good-person (or good-self) vs.~bad-person (or bad-other) was between 0.47 \textasciitilde{} 0.53, based on study 1a, 1b, 2, 3a, 4a, and 4b. Based on this effect size, we estimated that 54 participants would allow we to detect the effec size of Cohen's = 0.5 with 95\% power and alpha = 0.05, using G*power 3.192 (Faul, Erdfelder, Buchner, \& Lang, 2009; Faul, Erdfelder, Lang, \& Buchner, 2007). Therefore, we planned to stop after we arrived this number. During the data collected at Wenzhou University, 61 participants (45 females; 19 to 25 years of age, age = 20.42 \(\pm\) 1.77) came to the testing room and we tested all of them during a single day. All participants were right-handed, and all had normal or corrected-to-normal vision. Informed consent was obtained from all participants prior to the experiment according to procedures approved by a local ethics committee. 4 participants' data were excluded from analysis because their over all accuracy was lower than 60\%, 1 more participant waw excluded because of zero hit rate for one condition, leaving 56 participants (43 females; 19 to 25 years old, age = 20.27 \(\pm\) 1.60).

Study 3b has the same experimental design as 3a, with a 2× 3× 2 within-subject design. The first variable was self-relevance, include two levels: self-relevant vs.~stranger-relevant; the second variable was moral valence, include good, neutral and bad; the third variable was the matching between shape and label: match vs.~mismatch.
Stimuli. The stimuli used in study 3b share the same parameters with experiment 3a. 6 shapes were included (triangle, square, circle, trapezoid, diamond, regular pentagon), as well as 6 labels, but the labels changed to \enquote{good self}, \enquote{neutral self}, \enquote{bad self}, \enquote{good him/her}, bad him/her'', \enquote{neutral him/her}, the stranger's label is consistent with participants' gender. Same as study 3a, we asked participant to chosen an unfamiliar name of their own gender to be the stranger before showing them the relationship. Note, because of implementing error, the personal distance data did not collect for this experiment.

\hypertarget{procedure-5}{%
\subsubsection{Procedure}\label{procedure-5}}

In this experiment, participants finished two matching tasks, i.e., self-matching task, and other-matching task. In the self-matching task, participants first associate the three aspects of self to three different shapes, and then perform the matching task. In the other-matching task, participants first associate the three aspects of the stranger to three different shapes, and then perform the matching task. The order of self-task and other-task are counter-balanced among participants.
Different from experiment 3a, after presenting the stimuli pair for 100ms, participant has 1900 ms to response, and they feedback with both accuracy and reaction time.
As in study 3a, before each task, the instruction showed the meaning of each label to participants. The self-matching task and other-matching task were randomized between participants. Each participant finished 6 blocks, each have 120 trials.

We found the valence effect for self-referential condition (\(F(1.75, 96.42) = 6.73\), \(\mathit{MSE} = 0.30\), \(p = .003\), \(\hat{\eta}^2_G = .037\)) and other-referential condition (\(F(1.93, 105.97) = 0.61\), \(\mathit{MSE} = 0.31\), \(p = .539\), \(\hat{\eta}^2_G = .002\)). Post-hoc comparison for the self-referential conditions revealed that \emph{d}' was larger for good self (2.23 \(\pm\) 0.1087) than for bad self (1.66 \(\pm\) 0.098), \emph{t}(55) = 6.11, \emph{p} \textless{} 0.0001, Cohen's \emph{d} = 0.817, 95\% CI {[}0.511 1.117{]} , BF10 = 8.43, and neutral self (1.91 \(\pm\) 0.088), \emph{t}(55) = 3.03, \emph{p} = 0.0104, Cohen's \emph{d} = 0.404, 95\%CI {[}0.13 0.675{]} , BF10 = 1.33e+5. There was also higher d' for neutral-self condition than bad-self conditions, \emph{t}(55) = 3.02, \emph{p} = 0.0106, Cohen's \emph{d} = 0.403, 95\% CI {[}0.129 0.674{]}, BF10 = 8.22. For other-referential conditions, good-other (2.03 \(\pm\) 0.12) was smaller than neutral-other (2.28 \(\pm\) 0.133), \emph{t}(55) = -2.262, \emph{p} = 0.0699, but not the bad-other condition (2.19 \(\pm\) 0.122), \emph{t}(55) = -1.559, \emph{p} = 0.272. Neither evidence for the neutral and bad-other condition \emph{t}(55) = 1.11, \emph{p} = 0.51.

We also tested the effect of personal association by comparing \emph{d'} values for difference moral valence level. The results showed that the bad-self association condition was responded worse than the bad-other association condition, \emph{t}(55) = -4.1, \emph{p} \textless{} 0.001, Cohen's \emph{d} = -0.548, 95\% CI {[}-0.827 -0.265{]}, BF10 = 167. The neutral-self was also worse than the neutral-other, \emph{t}(55) = -3.15, \emph{p} = 0.0026 , Cohen's \emph{d} = -0.422, 95\% CI {[}-0.693 -0.146{]}, BF10 = 11.7. While the good-self association condition and good-stranger conditions are not differ from each other, \emph{t}(55) = 1.394, \emph{p} = 0.169, Cohen's \emph{d} = 0.186, 95\% CI{[}-0.079 0.449{]}, BF10 = 0.364.

\hypertarget{reaction-time-3}{%
\subsubsection{Reaction time}\label{reaction-time-3}}

The results of reaction times of matchness trials showed similar pattern as the \emph{d} prime data. We found three-way interaction between matchness, and valence (\(F(1.86, 102.47) = 15.44\), \(\mathit{MSE} = 3,112.78\), \(p < .001\), \(\hat{\eta}^2_G = .006\)) and then analyzed the matched trials and mismatched trials separately, as in previous experiments.

For the matched trials, we found that interaction between of valence and identity, \(F(1.67, 92.11) = 6.14\), \(\mathit{MSE} = 6,472.48\), \(p = .005\), \(\hat{\eta}^2_G = .009\), BF10 = 1.17. Then, the matched trials were analyzed for the self-relevance and other-relevance pairs separately. The results showed a significant effect of moral valence for the self condition, \(F(1.66, 91.38) = 23.98\), \(\mathit{MSE} = 6,965.61\), \(p < .001\), \(\hat{\eta}^2_G = .100\), BF10 = 4.54e+6. Paired \emph{t}-tests showed that responses to the good-self association (817 ± 119) were faster than to bad-self associations (915 ± 132), \emph{t}(55) = -8.78, \emph{p} \textless{} 0.001, Cohen's \emph{d} = -1.173, 95\% CI {[}-1.511 -0.828{]}, BF10 = 1.84e+9, and to neutral-self association (880 ± 116), \emph{t}(55) = 3.748, \emph{p} \textless{} 0.0001, Cohen's \emph{d} = -0.501, 95\% CI {[}-0.777 -0.221{]}, BF10 = 58.7. The neutral-self was faster than the bad-self associations, \emph{t}(55) = -2.41, \emph{p} = 0.019 , Cohen's \emph{d} = -0.321, 95\% CI {[}-0.589 -0.051{]}, BF10 = 2.03.

The effect of moral valence was also significant for the other-relevance conditions, \(F(1.89, 103.94) = 5.96\), \(\mathit{MSE} = 5,589.90\), \(p = .004\), \(\hat{\eta}^2_G = .014\), BF10 = 8.55. the good-other condition (734 ± 158) didn't differ from neutral-other condition (735 ±160), t(55) = -0.07, p = 0.946, Cohen's \emph{d} = -0.009, 95\% CI {[}-0.271 -0.293{]}, BF10 = 0.15, but faster than the bad other condition (776 ± 173), \emph{t}(55) = -3.14, \emph{p} = 0.0027, Cohen's \emph{d} = -0.419, 95\% CI {[}-0.691 -0.144{]}, BF10 = 11.3. The neutral-other condition also faster than the bad-other condition, \emph{t}(55) = -3.232, \emph{p} = 0.0021, Cohen's \emph{d} = -0.432, 95\% CI {[}-0.704 -0.156{]}, BF10 = 14.3.

We also analyzed the effect of self-relevance on the different moral valence levels. The results showed that for all three different valence levels, there the self condition was responded slower than other condition: good-self vs.~good-stranger, \emph{t}(55) = 4.29, \emph{p} \textless{} 0.001, Cohen's \emph{d} = 0.573, 95\% CI {[}0.288 0.854{]}, BF10 = 297.2; neutral-self vs.~neutral -stranger, \emph{t}(55) = 7.17, \emph{p} \textless{} 0.001, Cohen's \emph{d} = 0.958, 95\% CI {[}0.638 1.272{]}), BF10 = 5.77e+6; bad-self vs.~bad-other, \emph{t}(55) = 6.03, \emph{p} \textless{} 0.001, Cohen's \emph{d} = 0.806, 95\% CI {[}0.5 1.11{]}, BF10 = 100208.03.

For the mismacthed trials, we also found interaction between of valence and identity, \(F(1.93, 106.25) = 35.51\), \(\mathit{MSE} = 1,939.88\), \(p < .001\), \(\hat{\eta}^2_G = .019\). Further analysis showed that there was effect of valence for other-referential trials (\(F(1.95, 107.38) = 36.43\), \(\mathit{MSE} = 3,487.65\), \(p < .001\), \(\hat{\eta}^2_G = .051\)) but not for the self-referential trials (\(F(1.98, 108.81) = 0.27\), \(\mathit{MSE} = 1,295.05\), \(p = .760\), \(\hat{\eta}^2_G = .000\)). Post-hoc comparison revealed that bad-other trials (857 \(\pm\) 20.9) were responded faster than good (967 \(\pm\) 25.1), \emph{t} = -9.625, \emph{p} \textless{} 0.0001, and neutral (876 \(\pm\) 21.4) trials, \emph{t} = -2.263, \emph{p} = 0.697, good-other conditions were also slower than neutral-other, \emph{t} = -8.016, \emph{p} \textless{} 0.0001

\hypertarget{discussion-3}{%
\subsection{Discussion}\label{discussion-3}}

In experiment 3b, we separated the self-referential and other-referential tasks into different blocks so that participants had lower cognitive load when finish the task. We replicated the pattern from experiment 3a that the valence effect is stronger when the stimuli were self-referential. Contrast to experiment 3a, however, we found that the self-referential condition is out-performed by other-referential conditions. This pattern suggest that the self-referential enhanced the valence effect, and the advantage to self might be relative instead of absolute.

\hypertarget{experiment-4a}{%
\section{Experiment 4a}\label{experiment-4a}}

In study 1-3 participants made explicit judgments about moral associations. In Experiment 4, we examined whether the interaction between moral valence and identity occur even when one of the variable was irrelevant to the task. In experiment 4a, participants learnt associations between shapes and self/other labels, then made perceptual match judgments only about the self or other conditions labels and shapes (cf.~Sui et al., 2012). However, we presented labels of different moral valence in the shapes, which means that the moral valence factor become task irrelevant. If the binding between moral good and self is intrinsic and automatic, then we will observe that facilitating effect of moral good for self conditions, but not for other conditions.

In study 4b, we changed the role of valence and identity in task. In this experiment, participants learn the association between moral valence and the made perceptual match judgments to associations between different moral valence and shapes as in study 1-3. Different from experiment 1 \textasciitilde{} 3, we made put the labels of \enquote{self/other} in the shapes so that identity served as an task irrelevant variable. As in experiment 4a, we also hypothesized that the intrinsic binding between morally good and self will enhance the performance of good self condition, even identity is irrelevant to the task.

\subsubsection{Participants}\label{participants-6}}

64 participants (37 female, age = 19.70 \(\pm\) 1.22) participated the current study, 32 of them were from Tsinghua University in 2015, 32 were from Wenzhou University participated in 2017. All participants were right-handed, and all had normal or corrected-to-normal vision. Informed consent was obtained from all participants prior to the experiment according to procedures approved by a local ethics committee. The data from 5 participants from Wenzhou site were excluded from analysis because their accuracy was close to chance (\textless{} 0.6). The results for the remaining 59 participants (33 female, age = 19.78 \(\pm\) 1.20) were analyzed and reported.

\hypertarget{experimental-design}{%
\subsubsection{Experimental design}\label{experimental-design}}

As in Experiment 3, a 2× 3× 2 within-subject design was used. The first variable was self-relevance (self and stranger associations); the second variable was moral valence (good, neutral and bad associations); the third variable was the matching between shape and label (matching vs.~non-match for the personal association).
However, in this the task, participants only learn the association between two geometric shapes and two labels (self and other), i.e., only self-relevance were related to the task. The moral valence manipulation was achieved by embeding the personal label of the labels in the geometric shapes, see below. For simplicity, the trials where shapes where paired with self and with a word of \enquote{good person} inside were shorted as good-self condition, similarly, the trials where shapes paired with the self and with a word of \enquote{bad person} inside were shorted as bad-self condition. Hence, we also have six conditions: good-self, neutral-self, bad-self, good-other, neutral-other, and bad-other.

\hypertarget{stimuli-1}{%
\subsubsection{Stimuli}\label{stimuli-1}}

2 shapes were included (circle, square) and each appeared above a central fixation cross with the personal label appearing below. However, the shapes were not empty but with a two-Chinese-character word in the middle, the word was one of three labels with different moral valence: \enquote{good person}, \enquote{bad person} and \enquote{neutral person}. Before the experiment, participants learned the self/other association, and were informed to only response to the association between shapes' configure and the labels below the fixation, but ignore the words within shapes. Besides the behavioral experiments, participants from Tsinghua community also finished questionnaires as Experiments 3, and participants from Wenzhou community finished a series of questionnaire as the other experiment finished in Wenzhou.

\hypertarget{procedure-6}{%
\subsubsection{Procedure}\label{procedure-6}}

The procedure was similar to Experiment 1. There were 6 blocks of trial, each with 120 trials for 2017 data. Due to procedure error, the data collected in 2015 in Tsinghua community only have 60 trials for each block, i.e., 30 trials per condition.

We conducted 2 (Identity: self v. other) by 3 (morality: good, neutral, bad) repeated measures ANOVA. The effect of identity (\(F(1, 58) = 121.04\), \(\mathit{MSE} = 0.48\), \(p < .001\), \(\hat{\eta}^2_G = .189\)), also the interaction between identity and valence, (\(F(1.99, 115.20) = 4.12\), \(\mathit{MSE} = 0.14\), \(p = .019\), \(\hat{\eta}^2_G = .004\)). But not the effect of valence was not found, \(F(1.93, 111.66) = 0.53\), \(\mathit{MSE} = 0.12\), \(p = .581\), \(\hat{\eta}^2_G = .000\). We further examined the effect of valence for both self and other. For the self-referential trials, there was a weak effect of valence \(F(1.95, 112.92) = 3.01\), \(\mathit{MSE} = 0.15\), \(p = .055\), \(\hat{\eta}^2_G = .008\). Post-hoc analysis showed that good self condition (2.55 \(\pm\) 0.111) is slightly higher than bad self condition (2.38 \(\pm\) 0.105) , \emph{t}(58) = 2.339, \emph{p} = .0583. But there was no differences between good-self and neutral self (2.45 \(\pm\) 0.101), \emph{t}(58) = 1.575, \emph{p} = .264, neither between neutral-self and bad-self, \emph{t}(58) = 0.966, \emph{p} = .601. As for the other-referential conditions, the result didn't show effect of valence \(F(1.98, 114.61) = 1.75\), \(\mathit{MSE} = 0.10\), \(p = .179\), \(\hat{\eta}^2_G = .003\).

We conducted 2 (Matchness: match v. mismatch) by 2 (Identity: self v. other) by 3 (morality: good, neutral, bad) repeated measure ANOVA. There was a main effect of Matchness (\(F(1, 58) = 79.85\), \(\mathit{MSE} = 4,817.48\), \(p < .001\), \(\hat{\eta}^2_G = .123\)) and interaction between Matchness and Identity(\(F(1, 58) = 81.15\), \(\mathit{MSE} = 3,226.69\), \(p < .001\), \(\hat{\eta}^2_G = .087\))

We carried out two separate ANOVA for both matched and mismatched trials. The results showed that for matched trials, there was an interaction between valence and identity, \(F(1.90, 110.18) = 4.41\), \(\mathit{MSE} = 465.91\), \(p = .016\), \(\hat{\eta}^2_G = .003\).

We further broke down the interaction by analyzing the data for self and other pairs separately. There was a significant effect of moral valence for self-stimuli, \(F(1.97, 114.32) = 6.29\), \(\mathit{MSE} = 367.25\), \(p = .003\), \(\hat{\eta}^2_G = .006\), BF10 = 11.16.

We conducted 2 (Matchness: match v. mismatch) by 2 (Identity: self v. other) by 3 (morality: good, neutral, bad) repeated measure ANOVA:

There was a main effect of Matchness (\(F(1, 44) = 210.69\), \(\mathit{MSE} = 1,969.60\), \(p < .001\), \(\hat{\eta}^2_G = .180\)), main effect of valence (\(F(1.95, 85.74) = 5.35\), \(\mathit{MSE} = 2,247.66\), \(p = .007\), \(\hat{\eta}^2_G = .012\)), interaction between Matchness and Valence(\(F(1.87, 82.50) = 18.58\), \(\mathit{MSE} = 1,291.12\), \(p < .001\), \(\hat{\eta}^2_G = .023\)), and three way interaction (\(F(1.95, 85.99) = 3.70\), \(\mathit{MSE} = 285.25\), \(p = .030\), \(\hat{\eta}^2_G = .001\)).

We futher broke down the interaction by analyzing the data for self and other pairs separately.

RTs in good-self condition were facilitated but without performance being impaired for bad-self associations (relative to the normal neutral self)(see Figure 5).

The RT for good-other association condition (688 ± 66.9) is faster than the bad-other association condition (718 ± 49.7), t(44) = -3.353, p = 0.0017, Cohen's d = -0.4999, 95\%CI {[}-0.8075 -0.1872{]}, \(BF_{10}\) = 18.84. The RT for good-other condition is slightly faster than neutral-other condition (704 ± 57.1), but the evidence is not strong, t (44) = -2.21, p = 0.0324, Cohen's d = -0.3294, 95\%CI {[}-6278 -0.0275{]}, \(BF_{10}\) = 1.454. While there is is no strong evidence about the differences between bad-other vs.~neutral-other conditions, t(44) = -1.8267, p = 0.0745, Cohen's d = -0.2723, 95\%CI {[}-0.5685 0.0268{]}, \(BF_{10}\) = 0.743.

We also compared the reaction times for self- and other- association in different valence condition. we found that Good-self condition is faster than good-other condition, \emph{t}(44) = -2.165, \emph{p} = 0.0358; neutral self is slower than neutral-other condition, \emph{t}(44) = 3.064, \emph{p} = 0.0037. Bad-self and bad-other did not show difference, \emph{t}(44) = 0.623, \emph{p} = 0.5363.

For non-matched trials, there was no significant effect. Identity (\(F(1, 44) = 1.96\), \(\mathit{MSE} = 319.47\), \(p = .169\), \(\hat{\eta}^2_G = .001\)), interaction (\(F(1.88, 82.57) = 0.31\), \(\mathit{MSE} = 316.96\), \(p = .718\), \(\hat{\eta}^2_G = .000\)). But here are effect of Valence (\(F(1.69, 74.54) = 6.59\), \(\mathit{MSE} = 886.19\), \(p = .004\), \(\hat{\eta}^2_G = .010\))

\hypertarget{discussion-4}{%
\subsection{Discussion}\label{discussion-4}}

In experiment 4, we manipulated the task so that the moral valence (experiment 4a) or the self-relatedness (experiment 4b) become irrelevant to the task. We found robust effects of the tasks: when the self-relatedness is task related, the results showed a strong effect of self-relatedness; in contrast, when moral valence become task related the main effect of moral valence was strong. However, the task irrelevant stimuli in the shape also had influence on the performance. The good self conditions (the shape associated the self and with a \enquote{good person} within the shape) performed better than bad self conditions even when the self was the only task relevant stimuli. Also, good-self showed advantage over good-other when valence is the only task relevant variable while identity was not. Together, these results suggest that moral valence and self-referential can still couple together and facilitated the perceptual decision making even one feature of them is implicit.

\section{Experiment 5: Generalization of positive effect}\label{experiment-5-generalization-of-positive-effect}}

So far, we have considered the modulation effect of morality and found that the positive moral valence could enhance the perception. However, we still not sure whether this effect was moral specific or reflecting a more general mechanism of effect of positive valence. To test the specificity of morality, we conducted experiment 5, in which three more categories of stimuli were used (people of different attractiveness, scene of different attractivness, and emotional words with different valence). In this study, participants finished 4 session of association task, each with different categories of stimuli.

43 participant recruited from Tsinghua University university community (21 females; age = 22.47 \(\pm\) 2.48). All participants were right-handed, and all had normal or corrected-to-normal vision. Informed consent was obtained from all participants prior to the experiment according to procedures approved by the local ethics committee. The data from 5 participants were excluded from analysis, 1 participant did not finished the experiment, and the other 4 were excluded because of the overall accuracy was less than 60\%. The results for the remaining 38 subjects (18 female, age = 22.32 \(\pm\) 2.41) were included in data analyses.

\hypertarget{experimental-design-2}{%
\subsubsection{Experimental design}\label{experimental-design-2}}

A 4 × 3 × 2 within-subject design was used. The first independent variable was stimuli categories (morality, attractiveness of people, attractiveness of scene, and emotional words); the second independent variables is valence (positive, neutral and negative); the third variable was the matching between shape and label (match vs.~mismatch for the association). The task was to learn the association between each geometric shape and the self/other label.

\hypertarget{stimuli-3}{%

\hypertarget{d-prime-6}{%
\subsubsection{\texorpdfstring{\emph{d} prime}{d prime}}\label{d-prime-6}}

We conducted 4 (task type: morality, emotion, person, scene) by 3 (morality: good, neutral, bad) repeated measure ANOVA. The results revealed no effect of task type (\(F(2.95, 108.97) = 1.18\), \(\mathit{MSE} = 0.76\), \(p = .321\), \(\hat{\eta}^2_G = .006\)), but revealed effect of valence, \(F(1.85, 68.49) = 29.70\), \(\mathit{MSE} = 0.29\), \(p < .001\), \(\hat{\eta}^2_G = .034\), and their interactions, \(F(4.68, 173.09) = 5.85\), \(\mathit{MSE} = 0.31\), \(p < .001\), \(\hat{\eta}^2_G = .019\).

We then conducted ANOVA separately for four different tasks. For the morality task, the valence effect \(F(1.96, 72.66) = 2.22\), \(\mathit{MSE} = 0.21\), \(p = .116\), \(\hat{\eta}^2_G = .008\).

For emotion conditions, we found that main effect of valence \(F(1.69, 62.65) = 5.28\), \(\mathit{MSE} = 0.30\), \(p = .011\), \(\hat{\eta}^2_G = .030\). Post-hoc comparison showed that good (2.13, SE = 0.161) was not different from neutral condition (2.10, SE = 0.125), \emph{t}(37) = 0.163, \emph{p} = 0.9854, but both are higher than than bad condition (1.79, SE = 0.148) (neutral \textgreater{} bad, \emph{t}(37) = 3.588, \emph{p} = 0.0027; good \textgreater{} bad, \emph{t}(37) = 2.62, \emph{p} = 0.0332).

For the person appearance, the main effect of valence is significant, \(F(1.73, 64.02) = 27.22\), \(\mathit{MSE} = 0.26\), \(p < .001\), \(\hat{\eta}^2_G = .088\). Post-hoc analysis found that good condition (2.4, SE = 0.167) was higher than both neutral (1.71, SE = 0.175, \emph{t}(37) = 5.482, \emph{p} \textless{} .0001) and bad (1.70, SE = 0.182, \emph{t}(37) = 6.365, \emph{p} \textless{} .0001), but neutral and bad condition are not different (\emph{t}(37) = 0.197, \emph{p} =0.9788).

For scene appearance, the main effect of valence was significant \(F(1.79, 66.40) = 14.02\), \(\mathit{MSE} = 0.34\), \(p < .001\), \(\hat{\eta}^2_G = .072\). Post-hoc analysis revealed the same pattern as in person task: good condition (2.23, SE = 0.156) is higher than both neutral (1.57, SE = 0.178, \emph{t}(37) =4.683, \emph{p} = 0.0001) and bad (1.77, SE = 0.148, \emph{t}(37) = 3.414, \emph{p} = 0.0044), but neutral and bad conditions are not different (\emph{t}(37) = -1.893, \emph{p} = 0.1549)

\hypertarget{reaction-times-4}{%
\subsubsection{Reaction times}\label{reaction-times-4}}

As in previous experiment, we focused our analysis on the matched trials. We conducted 4 (task type: morality, emotion, beauty of person, beauty of scene) by 3 (Valence: good, neutral, bad) repeated measure ANOVA for matched trials only.

We din't found the main effect of task type (\(F(2.06, 76.12) = 0.56\), \(\mathit{MSE} = 7,041.60\), \(p = .577\), \(\hat{\eta}^2_G = .004\)), but the main effect of valence (\(F(1.82, 67.23) = 53.98\), \(\mathit{MSE} = 1,911.31\), \(p < .001\), \(\hat{\eta}^2_G = .076\)), and intercation between Matchness and Valence (\(F(3.58, 132.31) = 3.12\), \(\mathit{MSE} = 2,663.50\), \(p = .021\), \(\hat{\eta}^2_G = .013\)). We then analyze the effect of valence for each task type. We found that for all four task, the valence effect was significant: morality (\(F(1.89, 69.98) = 8.66\), \(\mathit{MSE} = 1,875.36\), \(p = .001\), \(\hat{\eta}^2_G = .036\)), emotion (\(F(1.48, 54.68) = 9.74\), \(\mathit{MSE} = 2,664.24\), \(p = .001\), \(\hat{\eta}^2_G = .072\)), person (\(F(1.78, 65.78) = 39.39\), \(\mathit{MSE} = 1,310.51\), \(p < .001\), \(\hat{\eta}^2_G = .162\)), scene (\(F(1.75, 64.69) = 17.71\), \(\mathit{MSE} = 1,820.73\), \(p < .001\), \(\hat{\eta}^2_G = .102\)). Post-hoc analyses revealed that for emotion task, the good condition is reacted faster than bad condition (\emph{t}(37) = 3.475, \emph{p} = 0.0037) but not neutral conditions are not different ((\emph{t}(37) = -0.77, \emph{p} = 0.7236)). The bad condiiton is longer than the neutral (\emph{t}(37) = 5.09, \emph{p} \textless{} 0.0001). The pattern is different for morality, person, and scence tasks, which showed that good is faster than both neutral ((\emph{ts}(37) = {[}-7.289 -2.4{]}, \emph{ps} \textless{} 0.0548)) and bad (\emph{ts}(37) = {[}-7.232 -3.817{]}, \emph{ps} \textless{} 0.0014).

The experimental design of this experiment is same as experiment 2: a 3 × 2 within-subject design with moral valence (good, neutral and bad associations) and matchness between shape and label (match vs.~mismatch for the personal association) as within-subject variables.

\hypertarget{stimuli-4}{%
\subsubsection{Stimuli}\label{stimuli-4}}

Three geometric shapes (triangle, square and circle, each 4.6º × 4.6º of visual angle) were presented at the center of screen for 50 ms after 500ms of fixation (0.8º × 0.8º of visual angle). The association of the three shapes to bad person (\enquote{坏人, HuaiRen}), good person (\enquote{好人, HaoRen}) or ordinary person (\enquote{常人, ChangRen}) was counterbalanced across participants. The words bad person, good person or ordinary person (3.6º × 1.6º) was also displayed at the center fo the screen. Participants had to judge whether the pairings of label and shape matched (e.g., Does the circle represent a bad person?). The experiment was run on a PC using E-prime software (version 2.0). These stimuli were displayed on a 22-in CRT monitor (1024×768 at 100Hz).
We used backward masking to avoid over-processing of the moral words, in which a scrambled picture were presented for 900 ms after the label. Also, to avoid the ceiling effect on accuracy, shapes were presented on a noisy background based on our pilot studies. The noisy images were made by scrambling a picture of 3/4gray and ¼ white at resolution of 2 × 2 pixel.

\hypertarget{procedure-9}{%
\subsubsection{Procedure}\label{procedure-9}}

The procedure was similar to Experiment 2. Participants finished 9 blocks of trial, each with 120 trials. In total, participants finished 180 trials for each combination of condition.

As in experiment 2 (Sui, He, \& Humphreys, 2012), subjects first learned the associations between labels and shapes and then completed a shape-label matching task (e.g., good person-triangle). In each trial of the matching task, a fixation were first presented for 500 ms, followed by a 50 ms label; then, a scrambled picture presented 900 ms. After the backward mask, the shape were presented on a noisy background for 50ms. Participant have to response in 1000ms after the presentation of the shape, and finally, a feedback screen was presented for 500 ms (see figure 1). The inter-trial interval (ITI) were randomly varied at the range of 1000 \textasciitilde{} 1400 ms.

All the stimuli were presented on a gray background (RGB: 127, 127, 127). E-primed 2.0 was used to present stimuli and collect behavioral results. Data were collected and analyzed when accuracy performance in total reached 60\%.

Post-hoc analysis revealed that shapes link with Good person (mean = 3.13, SE = 0.109) is greater than Neutral condition (mean = 2.88, SE = 0.14),\emph{t} = 2.916, \emph{df} = 24, \emph{p} = 0.02, p-value adjusted by Tukey method, but the \emph{d} prime between Good and bad (mean = 3.03, SE = 0.142) (\emph{t} = 1.512, \emph{df} = 24, \emph{p} = 0.3034, p-value adjusted by Tukey method), bad and neutral (\emph{t} = 1.599, \emph{df} = 24, \emph{p} = 0.2655, p-value adjusted by Tukey method) were not significant.

For non-matched trials, there was no significant effect of Valence (\(F(1.77, 40.67) = 0.35\), \(\mathit{MSE} = 242.15\), \(p = .679\), \(\hat{\eta}^2_G = .000\)). Post-hoc \emph{t}-tests revealed that shapes associated with Good Person (mean = 550, SE = 13.8) were responded faster than Neutral-Person (501, SE = 14.7), (\emph{t}(24) = -5.171, \emph{p} = 0.0001) and Bad Person (523, SE = 16.3), \emph{t}(24) = -8.137, \emph{p} \textless{} 0.0001)., and Neutral is faster than Bad-Person condition (\emph{t}(32) = -3.282, \emph{p} = 0.0085).

Informed consent was obtained from all participants prior to the experiment according to procedures approved by a local ethics committee. For day 1's data, 1 participant was excluded from the current analysis because of lower than 60\% overall accuracy, remaining 22 participants (8 female, age = 22.76 \(\pm\) 2.49). For day 2's data, one participant dropped out, leaving 22 participants (9 female, age = 23.05 \(\pm\) 2.46), all of them has overall accuracy higher than 60\%.

The experimental design of this experiment is same as experiment 3: a 2 × 3 × 2 within-subject design with self-relevance (self-relevant vs.~other-relevant), moral valence (good, neutral, and bad) and matchness between shape and label (match vs.~mismatch) as within-subject variables.

\hypertarget{stimuli-5}{%
\subsubsection{Stimuli}\label{stimuli-5}}

As in experiment 3a, 6 shapes were included (triangle, square, circle, trapezoid, diamond, regular pentagon), as well as 6 labels (good self, neutral self, bad self, good person, bad person, neutral person). To match the concreteness of the label, we asked participant to chosen an unfamiliar name of their own gender to be the stranger.

\hypertarget{procedure-10}{%
\subsubsection{Procedure}\label{procedure-10}}

The procedure was similar to Experiment 2 and 6a. Subjects first learned the associations between labels and shapes and then completed a shape-label matching task. In each trial of the matching task, a fixation were first presented for 500 ms, followed by a 50 ms label; then, a scrambled picture presented 900 ms. After the backward mask, the shape were presented on a noisy background for 50ms. Participant have to response in 1000ms after the presentation of the shape, and finally, a feedback screen was presented for 500 ms (see figure 1). The inter-trial interval (ITI) were randomly varied at the range of 1000 \textasciitilde{} 1400 ms.

All the stimuli were presented on a gray background (RGB: 127, 127, 127). E-primed 2.0 was used to present stimuli and collect behavioral results. Data were collected and analyzed when accuracy performance in total reached 60\%.

Because learning 6 associations was more difficult than 3 associations and participant might have low accuracy (see experiment 3a), the current study had extended to a two-day paradigm to maximizing the accurate trials that can be used in EEG data. At the first day, participants learnt the associations and finished 9 blocks of the matching task, each had 120 trials, without EEG recording. That is, each condition has 90 trials.

Participants came back to lab at the second day and finish the same task again, with EEG recorded. Before the EEG experiment, each participant finished a practice session again, if their accuracy is equal or higher than 85\%, they start the experiment (one participant used lower threshold 75\%). Each participant finished 18 blocks, each has 90 trials. One participant finished additional 6 blocks because of high error rate at the beginning, another two participant finished addition 3 blocks because of the technique failure in recording the EEG data. To increase the number of trials that can be used for EEG data analysis, matched trials has twice number as mismatched trials, therefore, for matched trials each participants finished 180 trials for each condition, for mismatched trials, each conditions has 90 trials.

There was evidence for the interaction between identity and valence, \(F(1.65, 34.62) = 3.86\), \(\mathit{MSE} = 0.10\), \(p = .038\), \(\hat{\eta}^2_G = .005\). We further split the self- and other-relevant trials. For the self trials, there was significant effect of valence, \(F(1.79, 37.62) = 7.35\), \(\mathit{MSE} = 0.09\), \(p = .003\), \(\hat{\eta}^2_G = .021\). Post-hoc comparison showed that the good-self condition (2.71, SE = 0.214) is better than both neutral-self (2.43, SE = 0.175), \emph{t}(21) = 2.98, \emph{p} = 0.0189, and bad-self condition (2.43, SE = 0.199), \emph{t}(21) = 3.93, \emph{p} = 0.0021. But there was no significant difference between bad-self and neutral-self, \emph{t}(21) = -0.097, \emph{p} = 0.995. For other trials, there was no significant effect of valence, \(F(1.73, 36.28) = 1.46\), \(\mathit{MSE} = 0.11\), \(p = .246\), \(\hat{\eta}^2_G = .004\).

For the matched trials, the interaction between identity and valence, \(F(1.62, 34.10) = 3.04\), \(\mathit{MSE} = 978.35\), \(p = .071\), \(\hat{\eta}^2_G = .005\). As in previous studies, we split the self- and other-relevant trials. For the self condition, the valence effect is significant, \(F(1.46, 30.76) = 6.57\), \(\mathit{MSE} = 1,007.62\), \(p = .008\), \(\hat{\eta}^2_G = .023\). The Self-good (480, SE = 16.9) is faster than self-neutral (504, SE = 17.3) , \emph{t} = -2.289, \emph{p} = 0.0795, \emph{df} = 21 and self-bad condition (508, SE = 17.9), \emph{t} = -4.342, \emph{p} = 0.0008, \emph{df} = 21. but not significant different between neutral and bad condition, \emph{t} = -0.503, \emph{p} = 0.871, \emph{df} = 21. For other condition, there was no effect of valence, \(F(1.91, 40.04) = 1.75\), \(\mathit{MSE} = 1,070.90\), \(p = .188\), \(\hat{\eta}^2_G = .007\).
